    "benefit":"This feat enables you to attract a loyal cohort and a number of devoted subordinates who assist you. A cohort is generally an NPC with class levels, while followers are typically lower level NPCs. See Table: Leadership for what level of cohort and how many followers you can recruit. Leadership Modifiers: Several factors can affect your Leadership score, causing it to vary from the base score (character level + Cha modifier). Your reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower you are trying to attract) raises or lowers your Leadership score: Other modifiers may apply when you try to attract a cohort, as listed below. Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When you try to attract a follower, use the following modifiers. Leadership Score: Your base Leadership score equals your level plus your Charisma modifier. In order to take into account negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but you must still be 7th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect your Leadership score, as detailed above. Cohort Level: You can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of your Leadership score, you can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than yourself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level (see Creating NPCs). A cohort can be of any race or class. The cohort's alignment may not be opposed to your alignment on either the law/chaos or good/evil axis, and you take a –1 penalty to your Leadership score if you recruit a cohort of an alignment different from your own. A cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party's XP. Instead, divide the cohort's level by your level. Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to you, then add that number of experience points to the cohort's total. If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than your level, the cohort does not gain the new level—its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level. Number of Followers by Level: You can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they're generally low-level NPCs. Because they're usually 5 or more levels behind you, they're rarely effective in combat. Followers don't earn experience and thus don't gain levels. When you gain a new level, consult Table: Leadership to determine if you acquire more followers, some of whom may be higher level than the existing followers.

If you have access to a marketplace in a settlement of village size or larger, you may invest up to 100 gp in that market; the exact nature of your investments isn’t important but is usually divided among several businesses. Once invested, you do not have access to this money for at least 1 month. As often as once per month you can visit the marketplace to see if your investments were successful. Flip a coin. If heads, that marketplace earns you 25% of your investment there; if tails, your investments made no significant profit for that period. Your skill with business means you never actually lose money from these investments unless disaster strikes the settlement (such as a plague or dragon attack), in which case your investment is lost. If more than a month passes between your visits to the marketplace, you only make one check to see if you make a 25% profit. If you send an agent to collect profits on your behalf, you keep half the profits and the agent keeps half. You may close out your investments during any visit, which ends your relationship with that market and returns you the full amount of your investment.

FAQ How does the Widen Spell feat affect spells with line effects? As written, nothing--lines do not have a width dimension, so that can't be doubled by the feat, and most line spells have a fixed range, which the spell can't exceed unless you're using Enlarge Spell. So, for most lines, Widen Spell has no effect unless you couple it with Enlarge Spell. Yes, it's strange, and we may end up revisiting this rule at some point in the future. Meanwhile, as a house rule (not an official update to the rules), it's fair to allow someone to use the Widen Spell feat on a line spell and actually double its range. You are, after all, increasing the level by +3, and if you're casting lightning bolt as a 6th-level spell, you ought to at least be able to get a 240-foot bolt out of it.\n\n–Sean K Reynolds (10/22/10)",

An arcane bond object that is a wand may become an awakened, intelligent magic. The awakened arcane bond item may never, under any circumstances, have an Ego score higher than 19. The total gold piece cost must be calculated as normal using the Intelligent Magic Item Creation rules. The wizard must only pay 50% of that cost however. Senses, powers and magical abilities the arcane bond object gains specifically due to becoming an awakened, intelligent magic item continue to function as long as the item remains within 30’ of the wizard. This in no way changes the rules for any other arcane bond ability or granted power (such as those gained from the standard wizard arcane bond class ability or the Improved Arcane Bond feat - the bonded object must still be worn or in hand for any of these abilities to function). If an awakened bond item is destroyed, the wizard immediately takes 1d6 points of ability damage to each of his three mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma).",

Obvious differences in the value between the exchanged items give your roll a +4 or –4 modifier, at the GM’s discretion (offering a clay cup for a jeweled dagger gives your roll a –4 penalty). The GM may rule that some items are too obviously valuable or worthless for this feat to apply (a king wouldn’t trade his crown for any item, and no normal person would trade an item for a piece of garbage). If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target is insulted and his attitude toward you worsens by one category. Once the exchange happens, make an Appraise roll opposed by the target’s Appraise or Sense Motive roll. If the target wins, it immediately realizes the true value of the object you offered it and behaves accordingly. If you succeed, it believes your false assessment for 1 round; for every 5 by which your check exceeds your opponent’s check, the deception lasts 1 more round. As with disbelieving illusions, the target’s ally can point out the true value of the object, giving the target another check with a +2 bonus.

    "special":"You can gain Equipment Trick multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of equipment. Sample Equipment Tricks Heavy Blade Scabbard Tricks In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (heavy blade scabbard) feat to use a trick. You may use these tricks with any sword scabbard designed for a heavy blade (see the fighter weapon groups on page 56 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). At your GM’s discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a scabbard intended for a light blade, but that requires a separate Equipment Trick feat and may be less effective. Capture Weapon (Improved Disarm): When you successfully disarm an opponent’s manufactured weapon, as a free action you may flip the disarmed weapon into your scabbard so long as the weapon would fit there. If you are not holding the scabbard in hand and attempt this, you have a –4 penalty on the disarm check. At the GM’s discretion, you can also use this trick on any item the opponent is holding as long as it would fit in your scabbard (such as a wand). You can only use this trick if you are wearing or holding your empty scabbard. Find the Hidden (Blind-Fight): You can use your scabbard to probe for hidden dangers. As a move action, you may sweep your scabbard through an adjacent square where you suspect there is an invisible creature; make a touch attack and roll the miss chance normally. If it hits and you have an available attack, you may attack that target once with a –2 penalty and no miss chance for invisibility. All other attacks you make against that creature (whether in that round or otherwise) do not gain this benefit (though you can sweep again on your next turn). Grab Purchase (Climb 5 ranks): You can use your scabbard as leverage to halt a fall, keep yourself from getting dragged, or prevent other sorts of involuntary movement by grabbing your scabbard with a free hand, jamming it into a hard surface, and clinging to it. Whenever you fail a Climb check, you may attempt to catch yourself while falling with a +10 bonus; your GM may rule that some walls require you to hold your scabbard with two hands rather than one or are too smooth for this trick to work. If subjected to involuntary movement such as a bull rush, you may spend a move action from your next turn to use your scabbard as an anchor, giving you a +5 bonus to your CMD to resist the movement. If you spend this move action, you only get a standard action during your next turn. Hurl Scabbard (Quick Draw): You can draw your weapon in such a way that you send your combat scabbard (see page 3) whirling off to strike at any creature in sight. This ranged attack is a swift action and is treated as a thrown weapon. Steer Opponent (Improved Bull Rush): You can use your scabbard to move a foe into the perfect position for you to make your attack. As a swift action, use your scabbard to make a bull rush against an opponent. If you succeed, instead of pushing him back, you direct your target into the path of your next attack. You gain a +2 bonus on your next attack roll against the target, and +1 for every additional 5 feet your bull rush could have pushed your opponent if you had chosen to push him back. If you fail the bull rush attempt, you are considered flat-footed against that target until your next turn.Tangle Leg (Improved Trip, Throw Anything): When you draw your weapon, you may send its combat scabbard whirling off to strike an opponent’s legs. This bonus attack is a swift action and requires you to make a trip attack against the target. The target can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent’s reach. Shield Tricks In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (shield) feat and proficiency in (non-tower) shields to use a trick. You may use these tricks with any light or heavy shield. At your GM’s discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a tower shield or buckler, but that requires a separate Equipment Trick feat for that kind of shield and may add a penalty on the associated roll. Break Ground (Improved Trip, Throw Anything): In place of a melee attack, you can throw your shield at an opponent’s feet, interfering with his movement and perhaps tripping him. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield or using a throwing shield to use this trick. Make a trip attack against your opponent. The opponent can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent’s reach. Whether or not you succeed, as long as your shield remains where you threw it, the opponent treats that square as difficult terrain until he moves out of the square.Hurl Shield (Throw Anything): You can throw your shield as a ranged improvised weapon. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield to perform this trick. If you are using a throwing shield, there is no reason to use this trick.Little Wall (Escape Artist 5 ranks): You can contort your body behind your shield in order to gain a brief moment of security. Whenever you use the total defense action, you may choose to gain cover instead of the normal dodge bonus to AC.Keen Eye (Perception 5 ranks): You have mastered the art of using the reflective surface of your shield to locate foes that you dare not look at directly. On your turn, you may choose to forfeit your shield’s AC bonus for 1 round to improve your defenses against one creature using a gaze attack. Your chance to avoid having to make a saving throw against that creature’s gaze attack increases to 100%, and the creature does not gain concealment against you. For every 5 ranks in Perception you have above 5, you may simultaneously use this ability against another creature with a gaze attack.Release Shield (no prerequisites): You may remove a light or heavy shield as a swift action instead of a move action. You may remove a throwing shield (see page 5) as a free action. Once you’ve removed the shield, you may hold it in one hand or drop it as a free action.Ricochet Shield (Deadly Aim, Throw Anything): When you throw a shield, you can bounce it off one or more hard surfaces in order to strike a target from an unexpected angle or to bypass an obstacle such as cover. Each object you ricochet your shield off of imposes a –2 penalty on the attack roll. Range increments apply for the total distance the shield travels, not just the direct distance between you and the target.Shield Gag (Improved Grapple, Throw Anything): You can force your shield into the mouth of a creature to prevent it from using bite attacks or other mouthbased abilities. Make a grapple check against a creature at least two sizes larger than your size category. If you succeed, you wedge your shield into its mouth. At any time you may release your shield, which means you both lose the grappled condition and return to your own squares, though your shield remains in its mouth. The creature may remove the shield by destroying it (or leaving it with the broken condition), forcing the shield out of its mouth with a grapple check against your CMB, or swallowing it (if it has the swallow whole ability) as if the shield were a creature.While the shield is in place, the monster cannot use its mouth to make attacks (such as a bite or a giant frog’s sticky tongue) against anything but the shield and cannot speak clearly enough to cast spells or use items requiring speech. If it uses a breath weapon, its range is half normal and any damage dealt must first get through the shield, with any remaining damage affecting the area normally.",

If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the deafening effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the deafening effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become deafened, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell. A thundering spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual level. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.",
