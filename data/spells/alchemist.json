The panacea has no side effects (for example, the intoxication panacea does not cause a hangover). When you use polypurpose panacea, choose one of the following effects. Analgesic: You do not feel minor aches and pains, such as from arthritis, a cold, or a hangover, for 1 hour. For the duration, you gain a +2 resistance bonus against pain-related spells. Clarity: You get a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check within 1 minute. You must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies. Hallucination: You have pleasant hallucinations for 1 hour, such as wandering lights, music, playful surreal animals, and so on. You can tell these are not real, but they are distracting, and you take a -2 penalty on Perception checks for the duration. Intoxication: You feel comfortably intoxicated for 1 hour, as if you had a few alcoholic beverages. Lucid Dream: If you take this panacea within 1 hour of going to sleep, you have a lucid dream that is under your control and lasts for an hour. Resistance: You gain a +1 resistance bonus on saves for 1 minute. Sleep: You enter a pleasant and restful sleep for at least 1 hour unless wakened. If you would normally begin sleeping at this time, when the panacea ends you continue sleeping normally. Sobriety: You become completely sober for 1 hour, negating any penalties to your actions for being drunk (GameMastery Guide 237). Magical and alchemical methods (such as detect poison) still detect you as inebriated. Time spent under the effect of this panacea do not count toward the time necessary to sober up (it merely delays your intoxication). Tenacity: You gain 1 temporary hit point for 1 minute. Wakefulness: You remain awake for 2 hours without feeling sleepy, and without side effects such as jitteriness. You gain a +5 resistance bonus against sleep-related spells such as lullaby and sleep. This use of the panacea merely delays your need for sleep and does not count as rest or sleep. You can use it multiple times in succession, but as each effect wears off, you are as tired as you would be had you not used the panacea.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Gain a relaxing or entertaining effect.","id":"1118","source":"Ultimate Magic","level_string":"alchemist 1, sorcerer/wizard 1","class_levels":{"alchemist":"1","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"1","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"1"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"S","costly_components":"0","duration":"see below","effect":"","range":"personal","saving_throw":"","spell_resistance":"","targets":"you"}},{"level":"1","name":"Recharge Innate Magic","description":"You channel magic energy into your own aura, recharging your innate magic abilities.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Subject is invisible for 1 min./level or until it attacks.","id":"298","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, alchemist 2, summoner 2, inquisitor 2, antipaladin 2, magus 2","class_levels":{"alchemist":"2","antipaladin":"2","bard":"2","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"2","magus":"2","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"2","summoner":"2","witch":"NULL","wiz":"2"},"elements":["dismissible","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"trickery","school":"illusion","subschool":"glamer","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 min./level","effect":"","range":"personal or touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (harmless, object)","spell_resistance":"yes (harmless) or yes (harmless, object)","targets":"you or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lbs./level"}},{"level":"2","name":"Kinetic Reverberation","description":"This spell converts the momentum and force from melee attacks made against the target of the spell, reflecting them back upon the attacker's weapon.

If the cloud is too large for you to affect with a single casting of this spell, you may instead inhale a portion of the cloud, but you must inhale the portion of the cloud closest to you. This spell has no effect on gaseous creatures. It can only affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to cast the spell in response. While inhaled, the cloud does not harm you. You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for up to 1 round per level, but you must hold your breath to do so (even if you do not normally have to breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you counts toward that duration. As a standard action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60-foot cone (or the cloud's original area, if smaller than a 60-foot cone). Any creature in the breath's area is subject to its normal effects, making saving throws and spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud's original DC. The exhaled cloud resumes its duration, if any. Exhaling the stored cloud ends this spell. If you do not exhale the cloud before this spell's duration expires, you suffer the cloud's effects and automatically fail any saving throw to resist it.","descriptor":"air","short_description":"NULL","id":"1547","source":"Advanced Race Guide","level_string":"alchemist 4, druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4","class_levels":{"alchemist":"4","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"4","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"4","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"4"},"elements":["air","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 round/level; see text","effect":"","range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"see text","spell_resistance":"no","targets":"one cloud-like effect, up to one 10-ft. cube/level"}},{"level":"4","name":"Age Resistance","description":"This spell functions as lesser age resistance, except you ignore the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution penalties gained at middle age and old age.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Ignore penalties from old age.","id":"979","source":"Ultimate Magic","level_string":"alchemist 4, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"4","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"6","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"6","summoner":"NULL","witch":"6","wiz":"6"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"24 hours","effect":"","range":"personal","saving_throw":"","spell_resistance":"","targets":"you"}},{"level":"4","name":"Air Walk","description":"The subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground.

At the end of a creature's turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about. Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the air walk spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.

You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. You may ask one question for every two caster levels. Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma due to your brain being overwhelmed, but also increases the chance of the power knowing the answer and answering correctly. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.) On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces. Avoid Int/Cha Decrease: You must succeed on an Intelligence check against this DC to avoid a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma. If the check fails, your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast arcane spells. If you lose Intelligence and Charisma, the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received.

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead. While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.) You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly. Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again. If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body. As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body. If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain. If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or the host's location.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Enables possession of another creature.","id":"336","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 5, alchemist 5, summoner 4, witch 5","class_levels":{"alchemist":"5","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"5","summoner":"4","witch":"5","wiz":"5"},"elements":["focus","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"necromancy","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, F (a gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"1 hour/level or until you return to your body","effect":"","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"Will negates; see text","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"one creature"}},{"level":"5","name":"Monstrous Physique III","description":"This spell functions as monstrous physique II, except it also allows you to assume the form of a Diminutive or Huge creature of the monstrous humanoid type.

This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formulae with the word \"\"bomb admixture\"\" in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active. When you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, it creates an invisible cubical prison composed of a solid wall of force. The prison is as large as the splash area of the bomb that you threw, and traps any creature that is entirely inside the area. Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless any creature within the splash radius is too big to fit inside, in which case the effect automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide means for escape, but the force walls extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. Like a wall of force, the cage created by the caging bomb admixture resists dispel magic, although a mage's disjunction still functions. The walls of the cage can be damaged by spells as normal, except for disintegrate, which automatically destroys the cage. The walls of this cage can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but the cage has a hardness of 20 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per alchemist level. Contact with a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation instantly destroys this cage. When using caging bomb admixture, an alchemist can only have one cage in effect at a time. If the alchemist throws another bomb during the duration of caging bomb admixture, any other cage created by the earlier admixture ends, and a new one is created.

You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other. In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane. Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 x 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10 x 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save). Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours. Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.","descriptor":"shadow","short_description":"Step into shadow to travel rapidly.","id":"478","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 6, alchemist 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"6","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"5","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"6","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"6"},"elements":["dismissible","mind-affecting","shadow","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"darkness","school":"illusion","subschool":"shadow","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 hour/level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"up to one touched creature/level"}},{"level":"6","name":"Statue","description":"A statue spell turns the subject to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried.

Chipping is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off one of the statue's arms constitutes serious damage.

The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement effects, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. Further, the subject can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces). The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet. True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairaudience/clairvoyance.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Lets you see all things as they really are.","id":"582","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 5, druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 6, alchemist 6, summoner 5, witch 6, inquisitor 5, magus 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"6","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"5","druid":"7","inquisitor":"5","magus":"6","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"6","summoner":"5","witch":"6","wiz":"6"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"knowledge","school":"divination","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (an eye ointment that costs 250 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"1 min./level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"yes (harmless)","targets":"creature touched"}},{"level":"6","name":"Twin Form","description":"This extract splits a perfect double of yourself from your body, dressed and equipped exactly as you are. You are able to shift your consciousness from one body to the other once each round as a free action. This shift takes place either immediately before your turn or immediately after it, but not during the round. You may act normally in the body you inhabit. Your other self is treated as though dazed, except it may take a single move action each round during your turn. Your twin cannot speak while you are in your other body, and cannot flank, make attacks of opportunity, or otherwise threaten enemies. Both you and your twin have the same statistics and start with the number of hit points you had when you ingested the extract. Once you have split, these hit points are tracked separately. Any spells, extracts, or magical effects (such as from potions) that were active when you ingested the extract are active for both you and your twin. If any such effects expire, are dispelled, dismissed, or otherwise used or ended, they end for both of you. Extracts or spells cast after you split affect you and your twin as though you were two separate targets. Your equipment is linked between your two selves, and if an item on one is consumed or destroyed, its duplicate is used up or destroyed as well. The body you do not inhabit crumbles into dust when the extract's duration expires or is dismissed. If the body you inhabit is destroyed, you immediately shift to your surviving self and the extract immediately ends. The body you left behind crumbles into dust, and you are stunned until the start of your next turn. If the body you do not inhabit is destroyed, the extract also ends immediately, but you suffer no ill effects. You have no special ability to sense what your second body is experiencing, though you immediately know if it has been destroyed. You may switch between bodies at any distance on the same plane. If your bodies cross into separate planes (including through the use of teleport or blink), the body you inhabit survives, while your other body is destroyed.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Creates controllable duplicate of you.","id":"918","source":"APG","level_string":"alchemist 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"6","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"NULL","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"NULL"},"elements":["dismissible","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (a blend of soil and the caster's blood)","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 round/level or until discharged (D)","effect":"","range":"personal","saving_throw":"","spell_resistance":"","targets":"you"}},{"level":"6","name":"Undead Anatomy III","description":"This spell functions as undead anatomy II, except it also allows you to assume the form of a Diminutive or Huge corporeal creature of the undead type.

If the creature has immunity or resistance to any energy types, you gain resistance 20 to those energy types. If the creature has vulnerability to an energy type, you gain that vulnerability. In this form, you gain a +8 bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects, disease, poison, sleep, and stunning. If the form has a vulnerability to an attack (such as sunlight), you gain that vulnerability.

You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently. Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like. A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others. For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.","descriptor":"air","short_description":"You and your allies turn vaporous and travel fast.","id":"612","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 6, druid 7, alchemist 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"6","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"6","druid":"7","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"NULL","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"NULL"},"elements":["air","dismissible","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"wind","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, DF","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 hour/level ; see text","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"none and Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"no and yes (harmless)","targets":"you and one touched creature per three levels"}}],[],[],[]]
