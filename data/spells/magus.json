If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft). Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras. Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two. Spell or Object Aura Power Faint Moderate Strong Overwhelming Functioning spell (spell level) 3rd or lower 4th-6th 7th-9th 10th+ (deity-level) Magic item (caster level) 5th or lower 6th-11th 12th-20th 21st+ (artifact) Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura).

Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.

Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment. An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect (although the normal miss chances still apply).","descriptor":"","short_description":"Creates decoy duplicates of you (1d4 + 1 per three levels, max 8).","id":"358","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, magus 2","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"2","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"2","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"2","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"2"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"deception","school":"illusion","subschool":"figment","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 min./level","effect":"","range":"personal","saving_throw":"","spell_resistance":"","targets":"you"}},{"level":"2","name":"Mount, Communal","description":"This spell functions like mount, except you can summon up to six light horses or ponies, and you divide the duration in 2-hour increments among the steeds summoned.","descriptor":"","short_description":"As mount, but you may divide the duration among creatures touched.","id":"1373","source":"Ultimate Combat","level_string":"magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner 2, witch 2","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"2","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"2","summoner":"2","witch":"2","wiz":"2"},"elements":["dismissible","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"conjuration","subschool":"summoning","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 round","components":"V, S, M (a bit of horse hair)","costly_components":"0","duration":"2 hours/level (D)","effect":"up to six mounts","range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"2","name":"Pilfering Hand","description":"You create and control an invisible telekinetic force, manipulating it with either startling abruptness or careful deliberateness, allowing you to seize an object from an opponent or remotely manipulate an object.

The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly. You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the DESCRIPTION of the detect magic spell. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.) If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.

Blink has several effects, as follows. Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment). If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike. Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane). While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures. You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material. While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones. An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.","descriptor":"","short_description":"You randomly vanish and reappear for 1 round/level.","id":"51","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, magus 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"3","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"3","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"3"},"elements":["dismissible","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 round/level","effect":"","range":"personal","saving_throw":"","spell_resistance":"","targets":"you"}},{"level":"3","name":"Burst of Speed","description":"Until the end of your turn, you gain a +20-foot bonus to speed (or +10-foot bonus if you are wearing Medium or Heavy armor), your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and you can move through the space of creatures that are larger than you are, but you cannot end your movement this round in a space occupied by a creature.","descriptor":"","short_description":"You gain increased speed, and your movement ignores attacks of opportunity and allows you to move through the space of creatures larger than you are.","id":"1306","source":"Ultimate Combat","level_string":"alchemist 3, antipaladin 3, magus 3, inquisitor 3, paladin 3, ranger 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"3","antipaladin":"3","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"3","magus":"3","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"3","ranger":"3","sor":"NULL","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"NULL"},"elements":["mind-affecting","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 swift action","components":"V","costly_components":"0","duration":"see text","effect":"","range":"personal","saving_throw":"","spell_resistance":"","targets":"you"}},{"level":"3","name":"Cloak of Winds","description":"You shroud a creature in a whirling screen of strong, howling wind.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Cancels one magical spell or effect.","id":"159","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"bard 3, cleric 3, druid 4, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3, inquisitor 3, antipala, magus 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"3","bard":"3","cleric":"3","druid":"4","inquisitor":"3","magus":"3","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"3","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"3","wiz":"3"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"magic","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"instantaneous","effect":"","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":"one spellcaster, creature, or object"}},{"level":"3","name":"Displacement","description":"The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location.

Make a ranged touch attack against the target; if the touch attack succeeds, the target takes 1 point of force damage per caster level. Whether or not the touch attack hits, the force hook drags you in a straight line to a square adjacent to the target. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The pulling hook keeps you from falling as part of this movement; therefore you can use it to cross a pit or chasm, or reach a higher or lower elevation. If the line of effect from you to the target passes through an area that is too small to fit your body (such as a portcullis or arrow slit), the hook pulls you to that location and you take damage as if you had fallen the distance from your starting point to that location. If you are restrained, such as being chained to a wall, the hook pulls you to the maximum extent of your restraints but does not break the restraints.

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes. Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides. Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level. Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains.

While subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the Disruptive feat. Creatures with the Spellbreaker feat (Core Rulebook 134) can easily bypass this defensive property, though they still take damage from the spell. Your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat. Lastly, the blades that serve as the focus for this spell can be enchanted for greater effect. When all of the blades share the same enhancement bonus and special weapon qualities, a creature that is damaged by this spell is also treated as if hit by one of these weapons. For example, if a 12th-level magus casts this spell using four +1 frost mithral daggers as focus, the damage dealt by the blades would be 6d4+1 plus 1d6 cold damage, as long as the daggers were commanded to be sheathed in ice.

Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust. Sustained Force: A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks. Combat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level). You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects). Objects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target. Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).","descriptor":"","short_description":" Moves object, attacks creature, or hurls object or creature.","id":"560","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 5, magus 5","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"5","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"5","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"5"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"concentration (up to 1 round/level) or instantaneous; see text","effect":"","range":"long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)","saving_throw":"Will negates (object) or none; see text","spell_resistance":"yes (object); see text","targets":"or see text"}},{"level":"5","name":"Teleport","description":"This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. Familiarity: \"\"Very familiar\"\" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. \"\"Studied carefully\"\" is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you've been there often. \"\"Seen casually\"\" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. \"\"Viewed once\"\" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as scrying. \"\"False destination\"\" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. On Target: You appear where you want to be. Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly. Similar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead. Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten \"\"scrambled.\"\" You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time \"\"Mishap\"\" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

It can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but a wall of force has hardness 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level.

Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through a wall of force in either direction, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually circumvent the wall by going around it, through material floors and ceilings).

A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.

You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of stone.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Restores petrified creature.","id":"524","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6, magus 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"6","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"6","summoner":"NULL","witch":"6","wiz":"6"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (a drop of blood mixed with earth)","costly_components":"0","duration":"instantaneous","effect":"","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"Fortitude negates (object); see text","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"one petrified creature or a cylinder of stone from 1 ft. to 3 ft. in diameter and up to 10 ft. long"}},{"level":"6","name":"Transformation","description":"You become a fighting machine- stronger, tougher, faster, and more skilled in combat.

The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement effects, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. Further, the subject can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces). The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet. True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairaudience/clairvoyance.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Lets you see all things as they really are.","id":"582","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 5, druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 6, alchemist 6, summoner 5, witch 6, inquisitor 5, magus 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"6","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"5","druid":"7","inquisitor":"5","magus":"6","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"6","summoner":"5","witch":"6","wiz":"6"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"knowledge","school":"divination","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (an eye ointment that costs 250 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"1 min./level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"yes (harmless)","targets":"creature touched"}},{"level":"6","name":"Undead Anatomy III","description":"This spell functions as undead anatomy II, except it also allows you to assume the form of a Diminutive or Huge corporeal creature of the undead type.

In this form, you gain a +8 bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects, disease, poison, sleep, and stunning. If the form has a vulnerability to an attack (such as sunlight), you gain that vulnerability.

The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space. A wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness. If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage while fleeing from the wall. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures. Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena. Iron created by this spell is not suitable for use in the creation of other objects and cannot be sold.","descriptor":"","short_description":"30 hp/four levels; can topple onto foes.","id":"600","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 6, summoner 5, magus 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"6","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"6","summoner":"5","witch":"NULL","wiz":"6"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"artifice, metal","school":"conjuration","subschool":"creation","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (a small iron sheet plus gold dust worth 50 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"instantaneous","effect":"iron wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level; see text","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"see text","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}}],[],[],[]]
