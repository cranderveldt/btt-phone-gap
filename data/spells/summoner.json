If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft). Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras. Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two. Spell or Object Aura Power Faint Moderate Strong Overwhelming Functioning spell (spell level) 3rd or lower 4th-6th 7th-9th 10th+ (deity-level) Magic item (caster level) 5th or lower 6th-11th 12th-20th 21st+ (artifact) Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura).

The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Magic mouth can also be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6thlevel caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away.

First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects such as charm person, command, and dominate person). This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using magic jar), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Subject is invisible for 1 min./level or until it attacks.","id":"298","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, alchemist 2, summoner 2, inquisitor 2, antipaladin 2, magus 2","class_levels":{"alchemist":"2","antipaladin":"2","bard":"2","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"2","magus":"2","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"2","summoner":"2","witch":"NULL","wiz":"2"},"elements":["dismissible","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"trickery","school":"illusion","subschool":"glamer","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 min./level","effect":"","range":"personal or touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (harmless, object)","spell_resistance":"yes (harmless) or yes (harmless, object)","targets":"you or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lbs./level"}},{"level":"2","name":"Levitate","description":"Levitate allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Cancels one magical spell or effect.","id":"159","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"bard 3, cleric 3, druid 4, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3, inquisitor 3, antipala, magus 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"3","bard":"3","cleric":"3","druid":"4","inquisitor":"3","magus":"3","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"3","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"3","wiz":"3"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"magic","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"instantaneous","effect":"","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":"one spellcaster, creature, or object"}},{"level":"3","name":"Displacement","description":"The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location.

Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance. This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only. A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself. You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20. A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above. This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa.","descriptor":"good","short_description":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","id":"330","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 3, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, inquisitor 3, summoner 3, inquisitor 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"3","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"3","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"3","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"NULL","wiz":"3"},"elements":["good","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","divine_focus":"1","domain":"good","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","costly_components":"0","duration":"10 min./level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"no; see text","targets":""}},{"level":"3","name":"Magic Circle against Good","description":"This spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from good instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.","descriptor":"evil","short_description":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","id":"332","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, inquisitor 3, antipaladin 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"3","bard":"NULL","cleric":"3","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"3","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"NULL","wiz":"3"},"elements":["evil","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","divine_focus":"1","domain":"evil","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","costly_components":"0","duration":"10 min./level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"no; see text","targets":""}},{"level":"3","name":"Magic Circle against Law","description":"This spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from law instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature.","descriptor":"chaotic","short_description":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","id":"333","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, inquisitor 3, antipaladin 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"3","bard":"NULL","cleric":"3","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"3","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"NULL","wiz":"3"},"elements":["chaotic","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","divine_focus":"1","domain":"chaos","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","costly_components":"0","duration":"10 min./level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"no; see text","targets":""}},{"level":"3","name":"Magic Fang, Greater","description":"This spell functions like magic fang, except that the enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5).

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes. Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides. Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level. Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (no save). Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.","descriptor":"cold","short_description":"Ice plane creates wall or hemisphere creates dome.","id":"599","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 3, magus 4","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"4","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"4","summoner":"3","witch":"NULL","wiz":"4"},"elements":["cold","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"evocation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (a piece of quartz or rock crystal)","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 min./level","effect":"anchored plane of ice, up to one 10-ft. square/level, or hemisphere of ice with a radius of up to 3 ft. + 1 ft./level","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"Reflex negates; see text","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":""}},{"level":"3","name":"Water Breathing","description":"The transmuted creatures can breathe water freely.

It retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that aren't extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities.

See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt. The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. All questions are answered with \"\"yes,\"\" \"\"no,\"\" \"\"maybe,\"\" \"\"never,\"\" \"\"irrelevant,\"\" or some other one-word answer. You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. You may ask one question for every two caster levels. Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma due to your brain being overwhelmed, but also increases the chance of the power knowing the answer and answering correctly. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.) On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces. Avoid Int/Cha Decrease: You must succeed on an Intelligence check against this DC to avoid a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma. If the check fails, your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast arcane spells. If you lose Intelligence and Charisma, the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received. If a successful contact is made, roll d% to determine the type of answer you gain. True Answer: You get a true, one-word answer. Questions that cannot be answered in this way are answered randomly. Don't Know: The entity tells you that it doesn't know. Lie: The entity intentionally lies to you. Random Answer: The entity tries to lie but doesn't know the answer, so it makes one up.

The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature (see invisibility). The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder's turn.

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead. While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.) You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly. Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again. If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body. As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body. If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain. If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or the host's location.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Enables possession of another creature.","id":"336","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 5, alchemist 5, summoner 4, witch 5","class_levels":{"alchemist":"5","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"5","summoner":"4","witch":"5","wiz":"5"},"elements":["focus","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"necromancy","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, F (a gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"1 hour/level or until you return to your body","effect":"","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"Will negates; see text","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"one creature"}},{"level":"4","name":"Major Creation","description":"This spell functions like minor creation, except that you can also create an object of mineral nature: stone, crystal, metal, or the like.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom. To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell. The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A dimensional anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see magic circle against evil) to make the trap more secure. If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the spell's effect and can escape or attack you. Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped). Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions. When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.","descriptor":"see text","short_description":"Traps extraplanar creature of 6 HD or less until it performs a task.","id":"388","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner 4","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"5","summoner":"4","witch":"NULL","wiz":"5"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"rune, void","school":"conjuration","subschool":"calling","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"10 minutes","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"instantaneous","effect":"","range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); see text","saving_throw":"Will negates","spell_resistance":"no and yes; see text","targets":"one elemental or outsider with 6 HD or less"}},{"level":"4","name":"Protection from Energy, Communal","description":"This spell functions like protection from energy, except you divide the duration in 10-minute intervals among the creatures touched.

Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. Familiarity: \"\"Very familiar\"\" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. \"\"Studied carefully\"\" is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you've been there often. \"\"Seen casually\"\" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. \"\"Viewed once\"\" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as scrying. \"\"False destination\"\" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. On Target: You appear where you want to be. Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly. Similar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead. Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten \"\"scrambled.\"\" You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time \"\"Mishap\"\" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.

You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell. When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \"\"walls\"\" and \"\"ceiling\"\" of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane's environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane's light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane. There are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane's light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could use move earth to create a hill or wall of stone to create a barricade. When you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as astral projection, etherealness, or plane shift. You are considered \"\"very familiar\"\" with your entire demiplane. As a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using limited wish, mage's disjunction, miracle, or wish and making a successful dispel check. If you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by the spell again to create a linked area between the two. You can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp. If you have cast create lesser demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting's area requires its own permanency spell.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Create your own demiplane.","id":"1022","source":"Ultimate Magic","level_string":"cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, witch 7","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"7","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"7","summoner":"5","witch":"7","wiz":"7"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"conjuration","subschool":"creation","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"2 hours","components":"V, S, F (a forked metal rod worth at least 500 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"1 day/level","effect":"extradimensional demiplane, up to three 10-ft. cubes/level (S)","range":"0 ft.","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"5","name":"Creeping Doom","description":"This spell summons four massive swarms of biting and stinging insects.

Additionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC.

If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.

Legends say that the first eaglesoul spell was created when an agathion avoral joined his own spirit with that of a courageous paladin who was about to be overwhelmed on the field of battle. The holy knight used the combined might of the agathion's great strength and his own to win the day for the crusaders. Now, although the spell is still in use chiefly among those that patrol the borders of the Worldwound, other champions of good have carried it with them to all corners of the Inner Sea region. When you cast this spell, you reach into the great beyond and beseech a good-aligned outsider for their aid against evil. The outsider infuses a small portion of its own power into you, making you a powerful force for good. You gain a +2 morale bonus on all Perception checks made against evil creatures, a +2 bonus on Initiative checks, and detect evil as a constant spell-like ability. In addition, once during the spell's duration you can call forth a surge of holy power when fighting an evil creature. Doing so is a swift action that shortens the spell's remaining duration so that its remaining hours of duration become rounds of duration. For the rest of this duration, the surge of power grants you the following benefits: • A +2 sacred bonus to AC • A +4 sacred bonus to Strength • Resistance 5 to acid and fire • A +5 sacred bonus on all Intimidate checks made against evil creatures • Fast healing 2 • Any critical threat roll made against an evil creature with a weapon you wield is automatically confirmed.

When casting the spell, the caster picks a one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic, or force. The ammunition within the siege weapon now deals that type of energy damage on a hit, though the amount of damage dealt by the ammunition does not change, nor does it change any of the other effects of the ammunition. Unlike other forms of energy damage, this energy damage does full damage to objects. Based on the type of energy the caster chose while casting, the ammunition also gains one of the following effects. Acid: The ammunition deals half its damage in a splash to all creatures and unattended objects within 15 feet of the target hit by the siege engine. Creatures can halve the splash damage with a Reflex saving throw. The DC of the splash is the same as the DC of the spell. Cold: The ammunition creates an ice sheen within a 20-foot-radius burst around the target of the siege engine's attack. That sheen lasts 1d6 rounds. Creatures within the ice sheen are entangled. Any creature within the area of the ice sheen at the start of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage. Electricity: Creatures hit by the siege engine attack or within 15 feet of the attack are staggered for 1 round. Fire: Creatures and wood objects within 15 feet of the attack may catch on fire (Core Rulebook 444 and page 164 of this book). Sonic: Creatures hit by the attack or within 20 feet of the attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be deafened for one hour. The DC of this effect is the same as the spell DC.

It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square in the area of effect, and the DC of Acrobatics checks within the area of effect increases by 5. The area is difficult terrain. A creature that moves into or starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 points of fire damage and must reattempt this Reflex save or become entangled. A creature that falls prone in the area takes a -4 penalty on its Reflex save against the tar and on Strength and Escape Artist checks to escape the tar. A creature that escapes the tar still takes fire damage from the tar until the spell ends or that creature spends a full-round action removing the tar. A creature with tar on it takes a -4 penalty on Acrobatics and Fly checks made to fly with wings or similar appendages.","descriptor":"earth, fire","short_description":"Converts the top layer of the ground into hot tar.","id":"1420","source":"Ultimate Combat","level_string":"druid 6, sorcerer/ wizard 6, summoner 5","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"6","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"NULL","summoner":"5","witch":"NULL","wiz":"NULL"},"elements":["earth","fire","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"20-ft.-radius burst","divine_focus":"1","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a ball of hardened tar)","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 round/level","effect":"","range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"Reflex partial, see text","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"5","name":"Teleport, Greater","description":"This spell functions like teleport, except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target.

True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means.

The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space. A wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness. If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage while fleeing from the wall. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.

Any creature that starts its turn within the area of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses DR/silver. Furthermore, the daggers ward off some attacks, in a way similar to the warding weapon spell (see page 48). While subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the Disruptive feat. Creatures with the Spellbreaker feat (Core Rulebook 134) can easily bypass this defensive property, though they still take damage from the spell. Your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat. Lastly, the blades that serve as the focus for this spell can be enchanted for greater effect. When all of the blades share the same enhancement bonus and special weapon qualities, a creature that is damaged by this spell is also treated as if hit by one of these weapons. For example, if a 12th-level magus casts this spell using four +1 frost mithral daggers as focus, the damage dealt by the blades would be 6d4+1 plus 1d6 cold damage, as long as the daggers were commanded to be sheathed in ice. No matter the modifications made to the focus weapons, they must always be mithral daggers.

Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item. A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect.

The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least half your caster level. You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1. For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to a third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding spells are dismissible. Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2. If you cast any of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature's save succeeds, all binding spells it has received are broken. The binding spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell. Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times. Slumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of binding is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect. Bound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect. Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast. Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. You can't dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or mage's disjunction affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane by dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect.","descriptor":"mind-affecting","short_description":"Utilizes an array of techniques to imprison a creature.","id":"41","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"8","summoner":"6","witch":"NULL","wiz":"8"},"elements":["dismissible","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"enchantment","subschool":"compulsion","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 minute","components":"V, S, M (opals worth 500 gp per HD of the target creature, plus other components as specified below)","costly_components":"1","duration":"see text","effect":"","range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"Will negates; see text","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"one living creature"}},{"level":"6","name":"Bite the Hand, Mass","description":"This spell functions like bite the hand, except as noted above.

You can use this spell to expand a demiplane you created with create lesser demiplane (you do not need to create an entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has a duration of 1 day/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add (or remove) one of the following features to your demiplane with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration. Alignment: Your plane gains the (mildly) chaos-, good-, evil-, law-, or neutral-aligned alignment trait (see Alignment Traits, GameMastery Guide 187). You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have. Bountiful: Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants adapted to near-darkness or underground locations. Elemental: Your plane gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water-elemental dominant trait (see Elemental and Energy Traits, GameMastery Guide 186). Gravity: By default a demiplane's gravity is normal and oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the Material Plane. By selecting this feature, the plane's gravity is heavy, light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional (see Gravity, GameMastery Guide 184). Seasonal: The demiplane has a seasonal cycle and a light cycle, usually similar to those of a land on the Material Plane, but customizable as you see fit (for example, your demiplane could always be winter, day and night could alternate every 4 hours, and so on). Shape: By default, the demiplane has a fixed shape and borders. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge (see Shape and Size, GameMastery Guide 185). You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane. Structure: Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what spells you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner). You can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 20,000 gp. If you have cast create demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting's area requires its own permanency spell.","descriptor":"","short_description":"As lesser create demiplane, but larger and with planar traits.","id":"1021","source":"Ultimate Magic","level_string":"cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"8","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"8","summoner":"6","witch":"8","wiz":"8"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"conjuration","subschool":"creation","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"4 hours","components":"V, S, F (a forked metal rod worth at least 500 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"1 day/level or instantaneous (see text)","effect":"extradimensional demiplane, up to 10 10-ft. cubes/level (S)","range":"0 ft.","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"6","name":"Dimensional Lock","description":"You create a shimmering emerald barrier that completely blocks extradimensional travel.
