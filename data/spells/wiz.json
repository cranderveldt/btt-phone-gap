Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras. Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table.

The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size. A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target's speed. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it-the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee weapons affected by this spell deal more damage (see page 145). Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell. Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

The panacea has no side effects (for example, the intoxication panacea does not cause a hangover). When you use polypurpose panacea, choose one of the following effects. Analgesic: You do not feel minor aches and pains, such as from arthritis, a cold, or a hangover, for 1 hour. For the duration, you gain a +2 resistance bonus against pain-related spells. Clarity: You get a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check within 1 minute. You must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies. Hallucination: You have pleasant hallucinations for 1 hour, such as wandering lights, music, playful surreal animals, and so on. You can tell these are not real, but they are distracting, and you take a -2 penalty on Perception checks for the duration. Intoxication: You feel comfortably intoxicated for 1 hour, as if you had a few alcoholic beverages. Lucid Dream: If you take this panacea within 1 hour of going to sleep, you have a lucid dream that is under your control and lasts for an hour. Resistance: You gain a +1 resistance bonus on saves for 1 minute. Sleep: You enter a pleasant and restful sleep for at least 1 hour unless wakened. If you would normally begin sleeping at this time, when the panacea ends you continue sleeping normally. Sobriety: You become completely sober for 1 hour, negating any penalties to your actions for being drunk (GameMastery Guide 237). Magical and alchemical methods (such as detect poison) still detect you as inebriated. Time spent under the effect of this panacea do not count toward the time necessary to sober up (it merely delays your intoxication). Tenacity: You gain 1 temporary hit point for 1 minute. Wakefulness: You remain awake for 2 hours without feeling sleepy, and without side effects such as jitteriness. You gain a +5 resistance bonus against sleep-related spells such as lullaby and sleep. This use of the panacea merely delays your need for sleep and does not count as rest or sleep. You can use it multiple times in succession, but as each effect wears off, you are as tired as you would be had you not used the panacea.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Gain a relaxing or entertaining effect.","id":"1118","source":"Ultimate Magic","level_string":"alchemist 1, sorcerer/wizard 1","class_levels":{"alchemist":"1","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"1","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"1"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"S","costly_components":"0","duration":"see below","effect":"","range":"personal","saving_throw":"","spell_resistance":"","targets":"you"}},{"level":"1","name":"Protection from Chaos","description":"This spell functions like protection from evil, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made by chaotic creatures.

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects such as charm person, command, and dominate person). This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using magic jar), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.","descriptor":"good","short_description":"+2 to AC and saves, plus additional protection against selected alignment.","id":"416","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric/oracle 1, inquisitor 1, paladin 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, summoner 1","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"1","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"1","magus":"NULL","oracle":"1","paladin":"1","ranger":"NULL","sor":"1","summoner":"1","witch":"NULL","wiz":"1"},"elements":["dismissible","good","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"good, purity","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 min./level (D)","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"no; see text","targets":"creature touched"}},{"level":"1","name":"Protection from Good","description":"This spell functions like protection from evil, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made by good creatures.

Any creature standing in the area where you first conjured the pit must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid falling into it. In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw with a +2 bonus to avoid falling into it. Creatures subjected to an effect intended to push them into the pit (such as bull rush) do not get a saving throw to avoid falling in if they are affected by the pushing effect. Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal. The pit's coarse stone walls have a Climb DC of 25.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Subject is invisible for 1 min./level or until it attacks.","id":"298","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, alchemist 2, summoner 2, inquisitor 2, antipaladin 2, magus 2","class_levels":{"alchemist":"2","antipaladin":"2","bard":"2","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"2","magus":"2","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"2","summoner":"2","witch":"NULL","wiz":"2"},"elements":["dismissible","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"trickery","school":"illusion","subschool":"glamer","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 min./level","effect":"","range":"personal or touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (harmless, object)","spell_resistance":"yes (harmless) or yes (harmless, object)","targets":"you or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lbs./level"}},{"level":"2","name":"Jitterbugs","description":"You cause the target to perceive itself as being covered in creeping, crawling, stinging bugs.

The thread created by lipstitch can be burst with a DC 20 Strength check as a standard action or can be sliced open with a piercing or slashing weapon (wielded by the target or an ally) as a full-round action. Cutting the thread provokes attacks of opportunity, while making a Strength check does not. Either option causes 1d6 points of damage and 1 point of bleed damage. The target has a 20% chance of failing to cast spells with verbal components until the bleeding is stopped. The effects of multiple castings of this spell do not stack. Optionally, the thread can be removed more carefully over the course of a minute with a DC 20 Heal check. If the check fails, the target takes damage and bleeds as described above.

The message, which must be 25 or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Magic mouth can also be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6thlevel caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

The head must be affixed to a pole, spear, tree branch, or other stable object, and the spell ends if the head or its object is moved. The head has darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision, can swivel in place to look in any direction, and has a +5 bonus on Perception checks. If you are within 30 feet of the head, as a standard action you can shift your senses to it, seeing and hearing from its location and gaining the benefit of its darkvision and low-light vision, and you may use its Perception skill instead of your own. While your senses are in the severed head, your body is blind and deaf until you spend a free action to shift your senses back to your own body. When you create the head, you can imprint it with a single triggering condition, similar to magic mouth. Once this triggering condition is set, it can never be changed. If you are within 30 feet of the head, you immediately know if it is triggered (if you have multiple active sentry skulls, you also know which one was triggered). This wakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb your concentration. For example, you could have a sentry skull alert you if any humanoid comes into view, if a particular rival approaches, if your guard animal is killed, and so on, as long as it occurs where the severed head can see it.

The target must have the physical capacity to articulate sounds, make gestures, or engage in whatever other method speakers of the language use to communicate with each other in order to actually converse. If the target lacks the mental capacity to grasp an actual language it still gains enough knowledge to respond to and carry out even extremely complex commands or suggestions coached in the language (whether written or spoken). However, since this spell does not endow the target with greater reasoning capacity, merely a temporarily enhanced vocabulary, the person offering up instructions to non-sentient creatures must take care to remove any ambiguity or guesswork.

You may project your consciousness to your animated skin or return it to your actual body as a standard action.

Your possessed skin is identical to you in all ways, except the following: It has only half the number of hit points you had at the time you cast the spell, and cannot be healed above this maximum; construct type, traits, and immunities; Str 3, Con -; DR 10/piercing or slashing; and compression (as the universal monster ability, Bestiary 2 295). Your skin can take any actions you could normally take in your own body (such as to fight or cast spells). When your skin leaves your body, your body's hit points drop to 0. Your body cannot heal damage naturally while you have no skin, nor do spells that cure hit point damage work on your body; only regeneration (from a regenerate spell, ring of regeneration, the regeneration monster ability, or any other effect that can regrow missing limbs) or heal can regrow your skin and allow you heal above 0 hit points. If your body is regenerated before your skin returns to it, the skin dies and your consciousness returns automatically to your body. Your skin can be preserved with gentle repose and is suitable for any purpose that requires some of your flesh (such as a resurrection spell) or any magic or ritual that requires a creature's skin. When your skin returns to your body, you regain hit points equal to your skin's remaining hit points. If the spell ends before you reunite with your skin or if your skin is killed while you are in your body, you remain helpless and at 0 hit points until your full body is restored to you (requiring powerful magic, as described above). If your body dies while you are possessing your skin, you die when the spell ends, regardless of how many hit points the skin has left.

These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become grappled by the sticky fibers. Attacking a creature in a web doesn't cause you to become grappled. Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is inside the web but is otherwise unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the grappled condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area of the web is considered difficult terrain. Anyone moving through the webs must make a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as part of their move action, with a DC equal to the spell's DC. Creatures that fail lose their movement and become grappled in the first square of webbing that they enter. If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover. The strands of a web spell are flammable. A flaming weapon can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away one 5-foot square in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.

Blast barrier, however, has proven to be an exceptionally versatile spell as far as terrains are concerned, for it works equally well in swamps, deserts, or any region where the ground is soft or easy to shape. When you cast blast barrier, you cause a rippling wall of loose earth, mud, snow, sand, or gravel to spring up in a designated space within the spell's range. This wall provides total cover to all Large or smaller creatures and objects. The barrier can only spring up in an area of natural, unworked ground. The energy that forms the wall's matrix is unstable, and you must concentrate to maintain the wall's shape. A blast barrier has an AC of 9, hardness 0, and 5 hit points per caster level. When a blast barrier reaches 0 hit points, or when you cease concentrating on maintaining it, the energies that maintain the barrier's shape fail with explosive results, sending sharp chunks of the materials comprising the wall and magical energy out along both sides. Any creature that is adjacent to a blast barrier when it explodes takes 2d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of sonic damage per 3 caster levels (maximum 6d6). A successful Reflex save halves the total damage done. Spell resistance applies as well. This instability can make using a blast barrier risky, but many of the spellcasters that pioneered the spell became experts at its tactical applications, often using the barriers to cover an escape while lobbing spells and parting shots, hoping to trigger the barrier's destruction just as their would-be pursuers approached.","descriptor":"","short_description":"","id":"1254","source":"Inner Sea Magic","level_string":"druid 4, ranger 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 4","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"4","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"3","sor":"3","summoner":"NULL","witch":"4","wiz":"3"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"sonic","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (handful of snow, earth, or gravel)","costly_components":"0","duration":"concentration, up to 1 round/2 levels","effect":"1-ft.-thick wall up to 10 ft. high by 20 ft. wide","range":"close (25 ft. + 5ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"Reflex half (see below)","spell_resistance":"yes (see below)","targets":""}},{"level":"3","name":"Blink","description":"You \"\"blink\"\" quickly back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane and look as though you're winking in and out of reality at random. Blink has several effects, as follows. Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment). If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike. Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane). While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures. You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material. While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones. An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.

You cannot use any spells or other abilities while within an image. You may leave the image at any time, returning you to your body. Once your consciousness departs from an object bearing your likeness, it immediately reverts to the appearance it had before you entered it.

Gilded whispers allows you to use a single coin as a conduit for an eavesdropping spell. When you use a divination (scrying) spell or item, such as clairvoyance/ clairaudience, scrying, or a crystal ball, you can choose to target a coin you have affected with gilded whispers instead of a creature or location (even if you would not otherwise be able to target an object), though any range limits on the scrying effect still apply. If the coin is held or carried by a creature, its owner receives any applicable saving throw against the effect. The caster of gilded whispers treats the coin as a familiar subject. The residual psychic impressions left upon the coin by other handlers help mask this dweomer from detection, protecting gilded whispers against location by detect magic, arcane sight, and similar effects unless the latter spell's caster succeeds on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast gilded whispers.

If you cast harrowing on another creature, you must remain adjacent to the target for the duration of the casting time. A harrowing must describe one set of events or course of action (for example, \"\"hunting down the pirate king,\"\" or \"\"traveling to Viperwall to search for a magic sword\"\") that the target of the spell intends to undertake at some point during the spell's duration. If you have access to a Harrow deck, draw nine cards when this spell is cast. If you do not have a Harrow deck, you can simulate the draws by rolling a d6 and a d10 for each of the nine cards, as detailed on page 293 of this book. Record the ability score and alignment associated with each card. Each of these cards grants a luck bonus or a penalty on a specific type of d20 check; the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card's alignment matches the target creature's alignment. If the card and target's alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit's check. If the card and target's alignments are of the opposite alignment (see below), the card inflicts a -1 penalty on that associated check. If the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit's check. While penalties persist on all associated checks for as long as the harrowing persists, the bonuses are one-use bonuses that the harrowed character can \"\"spend\"\" at any time to modify that card's associated check. You can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll. Since all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing are luck bonuses, they do not stack with each other. Penalties, on the other hand, do stack. Once you spend all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing, or once the spell's duration ends, the spell ends and the penalties are removed. A single creature can only be under the effects of one harrowing at a time. If it is subjected to a second harrowing while a previous harrowing is still in effect, the new harrowing automatically fails.

Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance. This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only. A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself. You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20. A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above. This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa.","descriptor":"good","short_description":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","id":"330","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 3, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, inquisitor 3, summoner 3, inquisitor 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"3","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"3","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"3","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"NULL","wiz":"3"},"elements":["good","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","divine_focus":"1","domain":"good","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","costly_components":"0","duration":"10 min./level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"no; see text","targets":""}},{"level":"3","name":"Magic Circle against Good","description":"This spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from good instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.","descriptor":"evil","short_description":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","id":"332","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, inquisitor 3, antipaladin 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"3","bard":"NULL","cleric":"3","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"3","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"NULL","wiz":"3"},"elements":["evil","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","divine_focus":"1","domain":"evil","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","costly_components":"0","duration":"10 min./level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"no; see text","targets":""}},{"level":"3","name":"Magic Circle against Law","description":"This spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from law instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature.","descriptor":"chaotic","short_description":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","id":"333","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, inquisitor 3, antipaladin 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"3","bard":"NULL","cleric":"3","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"3","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"NULL","wiz":"3"},"elements":["chaotic","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","divine_focus":"1","domain":"chaos","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","costly_components":"0","duration":"10 min./level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"no; see text","targets":""}},{"level":"3","name":"Magic Weapon, Greater","description":"This spell functions like magic weapon, except that it gives a weapon an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5).

The text containing the symbol must be at least 25 words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the sepia snake sigil springs into being, transforming into a large sepia serpent that strikes at the reader, provided there is line of between the symbol and the reader. Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike. If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of duncolored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level have elapsed. While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends. The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical. A dispel magic can remove the sigil. An erase spell destroys the entire page of text. Sepia snake sigil can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as secret page.","descriptor":"force","short_description":"Creates a snake-shaped text symbol that immobilizes reader.","id":"471","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"3","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"NULL","witch":"3","wiz":"3"},"elements":["force","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"conjuration","subschool":"creation","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"10 minutes","components":"V, S, M (powdered amber worth 500 gp and a snake scale)","costly_components":"1","duration":"permanent or until discharged; until released or 1d4 days + 1 day/level; see text","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Reflex negates","spell_resistance":"no","targets":"one touched book or written work"}},{"level":"3","name":"Serren's Armor Lock","description":"Upon pointing at an armored foe, you cause all of the joints of the target's armor to stiffen as otherworldly chains wrap around the target.

Stolen light stores images within a gem. To store an image, as part of casting you must touch a gem worth not less than 500 gp. You trap within the gem an image of everything visible within a 30-foot cone measured from the gem, in a direction of your choice. Alternatively, you can capture a less detailed image of a single object within sight. Once the casting is complete, the gem turns opaque, and the image inside cannot be seen. The stolen image remains within the gem until released or dispelled. To release an image, you touch a gem holding stolen light as a standard action and speak a command word chosen at the time of casting. For 1 minute per caster level, the image stored within the gem becomes visible. Details can be made out as clearly as they could be perceived at the time of casting. Darkvision is of no use for making out details in a stolen image, though low-light vision or other exceptional visual talents may reveal information the caster did not see. Light sources brighter than bright light are reduced to bright light in the stolen image. Once the image has been released, it cannot again be recovered from the gem. Stolen light can be made permanent with the permanency spell by a caster of 10th level for a cost of 5,000 gp. This leaves the gem capable of projecting the image indefinitely, activated and deactivated by its command word, until it is destroyed or dispelled.","descriptor":"","short_description":"","id":"1246","source":"Pathfinder Society Field Guide","level_string":"bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"3","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"3"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"illusion","subschool":"figment","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 full round","components":"V, S, F (a gem worth at least 500 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"permanent or 1 minute/level (see text)","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (object)","spell_resistance":"yes (object)","targets":"transparent gem touched"}},{"level":"3","name":"Strangling Hair","description":"Your hair animates and extends to grapple and constrict an opponent.

If the targeted cloud is a magical effect, you must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + the effect's caster level) to inhale it. Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal air in its place. If the cloud is too large for you to affect with a single casting of this spell, you may instead inhale a portion of the cloud, but you must inhale the portion of the cloud closest to you. This spell has no effect on gaseous creatures. It can only affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to cast the spell in response. While inhaled, the cloud does not harm you. You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for up to 1 round per level, but you must hold your breath to do so (even if you do not normally have to breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you counts toward that duration. As a standard action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60-foot cone (or the cloud's original area, if smaller than a 60-foot cone). Any creature in the breath's area is subject to its normal effects, making saving throws and spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud's original DC. The exhaled cloud resumes its duration, if any. Exhaling the stored cloud ends this spell.

Geb's hammer also has secondary effects based on the nature of the three bodies you use to create it.

A creature that makes its Will save is unaffected by the steed's fear aura for 24 hours. The ghost wolf may also be used in combat. Once per round, the rider may direct the ghost wolf to attack in battle as a free action (bite +10, 1d8+6 points of damage); unlike an animal mount, this does not require a Ride check or any training. Once the ghost wolf attacks, it lasts for only 1 round per level thereafter.","descriptor":"","short_description":"NULL","id":"1498","source":"Advanced Race Guide","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 2","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"4","summoner":"2","witch":"NULL","wiz":"4"},"elements":["dismissible","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"conjuration","subschool":"creation","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"10 minutes","components":"V, S, F (dire wolf tooth)","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 hour/level (D) or 1 round/level; see text","effect":"","range":"0 ft.","saving_throw":"none (see description)","spell_resistance":"no","targets":"one quasi-real wolflike creature"}},{"level":"4","name":"Globe of Invulnerability, Lesser","description":"An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower.

A sacrifice can be used in a variety of ways: Bargain: Making a sacrifice directly to the conjured being grants you a bonus on opposed Charisma checks made to compel the creature into service for the next hour. Enticement: Making a sacrifice the round before conjuring increases the DC of the Will save an outsider must make to resist being summoned. Payment: Making a sacrifice directly to the conjured being allows you to pay for one service from the creature in commodities other than gold. Reinforcement: Making a sacrifice the round before magic circle and preparing a summoning diagram increases the power of its warding magic, increasing the DC of all Charisma checks the creature might make to escape. This lasts 1 day. Multiple sacrifices can be made to affect a single conjuring, but the bonuses provided by this spell do not stack. Therefore, while you can make sacrifices to aid in summoning and bargaining with a creature, you cannot make multiple sacrifices (even of varying types) to enhance the same effect of a particular conjuration. A sacrifice may consist of any kind of commodity the target creature favors, including treasures, living creatures, or more ephemeral offerings. While this spell is not fundamentally evil, good-aligned creatures prove more selective in what offerings they accept, typically scoffing at blood sacrifices. Many sacrifices are fundamentally evil acts, such as murdering a pious innocent to summon a fiend. Any creature might reject certain types of sacrifices, thus denying you the benefits of this spell, as the offering must appeal to the target-few outsiders would care for 2,000 gp worth of parchment, while 2,000 gp of diamonds would be widely coveted. The GM determines what sacrifices creatures find appealing. The Sacrifice Effects table on the previous page lists a number of likely offerings, along with the bonus such gifts effect and the offering's equivalent value in gold pieces for the purposes of planar ally. Several of these sacrifices involve the loss of ability scores, levels, lives, or even changes in alignment. Any change wrought by such sacrifices (loss of ability score or level, or change in alignment) cannot be recovered, cured, or undone by any spell or effect short of miracle or wish. The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells. Any object sacrificed with this spell is effectively destroyed or removed to an extraplanar holding of the summoned creature's choice. The bonuses and values noted on the sacrifices table are guidelines for offerings; certain types of treasures or lives might prove especially valuable to specific creatures, with extraordinary sacrifices (like a potent artifact or the life of a high-level paladin) garnering increased bonuses. You cannot make greater sacrifices than those noted on the table to gain increased bonuses or gold values. For example, you could not gain two permanent negative levels to gain a +16 bonus nor gain increased benefit from slaying 20 HD worth of creatures to pay for a 10 HD creature's service.","descriptor":"mind-affecting","short_description":"","id":"624","source":"Book of the Dammed V1","level_string":"cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"4","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"4","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"4"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"enchantment","subschool":"charm","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 minute","components":"V, S, M (see text)","costly_components":"0","duration":"instantaneous, 1 hour, or 1 day (see text)","effect":"","range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":"one summoned outsider or elemental (see text)"}},{"level":"4","name":"Scrying","description":"You can observe a creature at any distance.

Any creature that interacts with the spell can make a Will save to recognize its true nature. Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow conjuration's level (4th) rather than the spell's normal level. In addition, any effect created by shadow conjuration allows spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not. Shadow objects or substances have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work. A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work.

The space holds as many as 10 creatures of any size. When this spell is cast upon a 5-foot-square part of a wall, it creates an extradimensional space adjacent to the Plane of Shadow. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden beyond the reach of spells (including divinations) unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as 10 creatures (of any size). The entrance to the extradimensional space remains visible as an area that is darker than the ambient illumination. Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 5-foot-by-5-foot door or window were centered on the affected surface. The window is invisible (though it is within the shadowed entrance to the spell, which is visible), and even creatures that can see the window from the outside can't see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space is ejected when the spell ends. Only one creature may enter or exit the extradimensional space at a time. The entrance is only open when the area around it is in dim light. Any other level of light (brighter or darker) closes the entrance, trapping creatures inside the extradimensional space.

In the area of effect of this spell, primal magic events cannot be triggered. The emanation grants a +4 circumstance bonus on all saving throws against effects generated by primal magic outside of the spell's effect that expand into the area. Unfortunately, suppressed primal magic tends to build up around the emanation created by this spell. When suppress primal magic's duration ends (or when the spell is dispelled), a primal magic event is immediately triggered at the center of the emanation if that point is still in an area where primal magic is active. The CR of this event is equal to the caster level of the recently ended suppress primal magic spell. The original caster of the suppress primal magic spell can attempt to negate this triggered primal magic event by making a DC 20 Will save-most spellcasters instead relocate to an area not affected by primal magic if they can so that they can end the spell's effect safely.","descriptor":"","short_description":"","id":"1283","source":"Inner Sea Magic","level_string":"cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"4","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"4","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"4"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (a pinch of sand from the Spellscar Desert)","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 round/level","effect":"","range":"10 ft.","saving_throw":"","spell_resistance":"","targets":""}},{"level":"4","name":"Symbol of Revelation","description":"This spell functions as symbol of death, except it is only activated by invisible creatures, creatures affected by an illusion (glamer) effect, creatures with the shapechanger subtype, or creatures that have magically changed their shape.

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes. Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides. Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level. Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (no save). Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.","descriptor":"cold","short_description":"Ice plane creates wall or hemisphere creates dome.","id":"599","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 3, magus 4","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"4","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"4","summoner":"3","witch":"NULL","wiz":"4"},"elements":["cold","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"evocation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (a piece of quartz or rock crystal)","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 min./level","effect":"anchored plane of ice, up to one 10-ft. square/level, or hemisphere of ice with a radius of up to 3 ft. + 1 ft./level","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"Reflex negates; see text","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":""}},{"level":"4","name":"Wandering Star Motes","description":"You create sparkling motes of bright light that shoot toward the target and swirl around it in a complex pattern.

On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces. Avoid Int/Cha Decrease: You must succeed on an Intelligence check against this DC to avoid a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma. If the check fails, your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast arcane spells. If you lose Intelligence and Charisma, the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received. If a successful contact is made, roll d% to determine the type of answer you gain. True Answer: You get a true, one-word answer. Questions that cannot be answered in this way are answered randomly. Don't Know: The entity tells you that it doesn't know. Lie: The entity intentionally lies to you. Random Answer: The entity tries to lie but doesn't know the answer, so it makes one up.

If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as \"\"Come here,\"\" \"\"Go there,\"\" \"\"Fight,\"\" and \"\"Stand still.\"\" You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description). Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action. By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on. Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it. If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.

Unlike other forms of energy damage, this energy damage does full damage to objects. Based on the type of energy the caster chose while casting, the ammunition also gains one of the following effects. Acid: The ammunition deals half its damage in a splash to all creatures and unattended objects within 15 feet of the target hit by the siege engine. Creatures can halve the splash damage with a Reflex saving throw. The DC of the splash is the same as the DC of the spell. Cold: The ammunition creates an ice sheen within a 20-foot-radius burst around the target of the siege engine's attack. That sheen lasts 1d6 rounds. Creatures within the ice sheen are entangled. Any creature within the area of the ice sheen at the start of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage. Electricity: Creatures hit by the siege engine attack or within 15 feet of the attack are staggered for 1 round. Fire: Creatures and wood objects within 15 feet of the attack may catch on fire (Core Rulebook 444 and page 164 of this book).

Any creature entering the geyser, or occupying the square it appears in, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid being hurled into the air and then tossed to the ground. If the creature fails its saving throw, it takes 3d6 points of fire damage from the boiling water and also takes falling damage based upon the height of the geyser (e.g., if the geyser is 50 feet tall, the creature takes 5d6 falling damage), landing prone in a random square adjacent to the geyser. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the creature's normal movement. In addition, the geyser sprays boiling water in a hemispherical emanation around its square.

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead. While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.) You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly. Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again. If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body. As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body. If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain. If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or the host's location.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Enables possession of another creature.","id":"336","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 5, alchemist 5, summoner 4, witch 5","class_levels":{"alchemist":"5","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"5","summoner":"4","witch":"5","wiz":"5"},"elements":["focus","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"necromancy","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, F (a gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"1 hour/level or until you return to your body","effect":"","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"Will negates; see text","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"one creature"}},{"level":"5","name":"Major Creation","description":"This spell functions like minor creation, except that you can also create an object of mineral nature: stone, crystal, metal, or the like.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom. To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell. The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A dimensional anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see magic circle against evil) to make the trap more secure. If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the spell's effect and can escape or attack you. Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped). Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well. In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears. If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist.

If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you. The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be. To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After 60 days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.

For example, you could erase a single battle from a creature's memory, or all knowledge of a plot to assassinate a king. The memories you remove are stored within the gem used at the time of casting. If the gem is shattered, the memories return to the creature as long as the two are within 30 feet of each other. Once sequester thoughts has been cast, the spell remains active on the gem and can be dispelled (which shatters it). No portion of the spell remains active on the target creature, and the target does not radiate magic as a consequence of the spell, nor can its memories be returned by dispelling the creature or subjecting it to antimagic. If the gem is shattered or dispelled out of range from the creature, the thoughts sequestered within are forever lost save by the use of wish, miracle, or the like. Sequester thoughts protects against detect thoughts, zone of truth, discern lies, and similar spells where the memories removed are concerned, though careful questioning may reveal the gaps in the creature's memory, or that it has been affected by the spell.

Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust. Sustained Force: A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks. Combat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level). You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects). Objects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target. Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).","descriptor":"","short_description":" Moves object, attacks creature, or hurls object or creature.","id":"560","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 5, magus 5","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"5","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"5","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"5"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"concentration (up to 1 round/level) or instantaneous; see text","effect":"","range":"long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)","saving_throw":"Will negates (object) or none; see text","spell_resistance":"yes (object); see text","targets":"or see text"}},{"level":"5","name":"Telepathic Bond","description":"You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing creatures, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher.

Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. Familiarity: \"\"Very familiar\"\" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. \"\"Studied carefully\"\" is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you've been there often. \"\"Seen casually\"\" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. \"\"Viewed once\"\" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as scrying. \"\"False destination\"\" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. On Target: You appear where you want to be. Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly. Similar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead. Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten \"\"scrambled.\"\" You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time \"\"Mishap\"\" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a -2 penalty on attack rolls and AC. Brush or similar material thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet. If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the targeted area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves. Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell. The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance-but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days.

A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.

Any creature that starts its turn within the area of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses DR/silver. Furthermore, the daggers ward off some attacks, in a way similar to the warding weapon spell (see page 48). While subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the Disruptive feat. Creatures with the Spellbreaker feat (Core Rulebook 134) can easily bypass this defensive property, though they still take damage from the spell. Your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat. Lastly, the blades that serve as the focus for this spell can be enchanted for greater effect. When all of the blades share the same enhancement bonus and special weapon qualities, a creature that is damaged by this spell is also treated as if hit by one of these weapons. For example, if a 12th-level magus casts this spell using four +1 frost mithral daggers as focus, the damage dealt by the blades would be 6d4+1 plus 1d6 cold damage, as long as the daggers were commanded to be sheathed in ice.

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines. An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration. Summoned creatures of any type wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.) A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field. Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.

The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level Ã— 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures. Raise Water: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates.

Even after the panic ends, the creature remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes panicked again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect. Comatose: The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a sleep effect, and thus elves are not immune to it.

You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area. Fog: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no. Arcane Locks: All doors in the warded area are arcane locked. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no. Webs: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the web spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for web. Spell Resistance: no. Confusion: Where there are choices in direction-such as a corridor intersection or side passage-a minor confusion-type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is a mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: yes. Lost Doors: One door per caster level is covered by a silent image to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance: no. In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects. 1. Dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no. 2. A magic mouth in two places. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no. 3. A stinking cloud in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for stinking cloud. Spell Resistance: no. 4. A gust of wind in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: yes. 5. A suggestion in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell Resistance: yes.

Only permanent magic items may be enhanced by this spell-one-use items and charged items cannot be affected by impart mind. Intelligent magic items cannot be affected by impart mind. When you cast impart mind on a magic item, the item gains an Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma score of 10 and gains your alignment. You have no special control over the item once it becomes intelligent, although since it has your alignment, personality conflicts with items you wield won't be a problem. Determine the item's ego normally, as per the rules on intelligent items in the Core Rulebook. An item made intelligent via impart mind communicates via speech and has normal senses to a range of 60 feet. It speaks and reads one language known by you-if you know multiple languages, you may choose which language the item knows. When you cast impart mind on an item, roll once on Table 15-24 on page 534 of the Core Rulebook to randomly determine the item's power-add your caster level to this roll. By expending additional diamond dust in excess of the 1,000 gp worth of material components required to cast this spell, you can gain further bonuses on the d% roll made to determine the item's power. Every additional 100 gp in diamond dust you use in excess grants a cumulative +1 bonus to the roll, up to a maximum additional bonus equal to your caster level. If the item gains the ability to cast a spell, determine the spell it can cast randomly from spells you know of the appropriate level. If the item gains ranks in a skill, it gains ranks in a random skill in which you have at least 1 rank. If you roll above 100, then you can choose one item power on Table 15-24 in the Core Rulebook to grant the item, and the item gains a special purpose.

You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other. In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane. Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 x 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10 x 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save). Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours. Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you).

When scribing a symbol of sealing, you can specify a password or phrase that allows a creature speaking it to bypass the seal and pass through the opening. You can also attune any number of creatures to the symbol of sealing, but doing this extends the casting time as described under symbol of death (Core Rulebook 355). However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attuned-the password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered. A disintegrate spell or similar effect can destroy the wall of force created by the symbol if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level.

The target humanoid can be either conscious or unconscious, but must understand your language. Upon casting this spell, you must state a course of action you wish the target to take. This course of action must be described in 20 words or fewer. You must then state the condition under which you wish the target to take this action, also describing it in 20 or fewer words. Actions or conditions more elaborate than 20 words cause the spell to fail. Unconscious agenda cannot compel a target to kill himself, though it can compel him to perform exceedingly dangerous acts, face impossible odds, or undertake almost any other course of activity. You cannot issue new commands to the target after the spell is cast. If the target fails his save against this spell, he is not compelled to act in any way until the specified trigger circumstances are encountered. He also has no knowledge of the details of the spell affecting him, and has no memory of the last 10 minutes (although he might come to notice the missing time or the presence of the caster). He can function as he wishes until the events you detailed as the condition take place. Upon experiencing the prerequisite condition, the target is forced to perform the course of action you described as per the spell dominate person. (If the compelled action is against the victim's nature, he immediately gains a new saving throw at a +5 bonus against the spell to end its effects.) For the next hour, the target acts as you dictated, doing all he can to fulfill your command. If, at the end of the hour, the target still has not completed your command, the target is released from the enchantment and the spell ends. Once the course of action is completed, the spell ends. The target has full memory of acts performed during this hour. It's difficult to detect an unconscious agenda before the spell is triggered. Casting detect magic on one affected by it only reveals an aura of enchantment if the caster of detect magic has a higher caster level then the caster of unconscious agenda. Even if the spell is detected, it can only be removed by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish. Dispel magic does not affect unconscious agenda.","descriptor":"language-dependent, mind-affecting","short_description":"NULL","id":"1579","source":"RotRL-AE-Appendix","level_string":"bard 6, inquisitor 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"6","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"6","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"6","summoner":"NULL","witch":"6","wiz":"6"},"elements":["dismissible","mind-affecting","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"enchantment","subschool":"compulsion","language_dependent":"1"},"casting":{"casting_time":"10 minutes","components":"V","costly_components":"0","duration":"One week/level or until discharged (D)","effect":"","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"Will negates","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"One humanoid"}},{"level":"6","name":"Undead Anatomy III","description":"This spell functions as undead anatomy II, except it also allows you to assume the form of a Diminutive or Huge corporeal creature of the undead type.

The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space. A wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness. If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves.

The cannon's attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).

You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell. When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \"\"walls\"\" and \"\"ceiling\"\" of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane's environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane's light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane. There are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane's light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could use move earth to create a hill or wall of stone to create a barricade. When you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as astral projection, etherealness, or plane shift. You are considered \"\"very familiar\"\" with your entire demiplane. As a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using limited wish, mage's disjunction, miracle, or wish and making a successful dispel check. If you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by the spell again to create a linked area between the two. You can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp. If you have cast create lesser demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting's area requires its own permanency spell.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Create your own demiplane.","id":"1022","source":"Ultimate Magic","level_string":"cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, witch 7","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"7","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"7","summoner":"5","witch":"7","wiz":"7"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"conjuration","subschool":"creation","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"2 hours","components":"V, S, F (a forked metal rod worth at least 500 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"1 day/level","effect":"extradimensional demiplane, up to three 10-ft. cubes/level (S)","range":"0 ft.","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"7","name":"Deflection","description":"You surround yourself in a whirling barrier of force that sends any attack that misses you hurling back toward its source.

The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, goes out of your sight, or you are not directing it, it returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round's target. The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. The sword's AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus). If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time mage's sword strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.","descriptor":"force","short_description":"Floating magic blade strikes opponents.","id":"328","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 7","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"7","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"7"},"elements":["dismissible","focus","force","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"evocation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, F (a miniature platinum sword worth 250 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"1 round/level","effect":"one sword","range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":""}},{"level":"7","name":"Phantasmal Revenge","description":"When you cast this eerie spell upon a recently slain creature, you cause a ghastly, spectral image of it to rise up from its corpse, shrieking for vengeance before it vanishes in a burst of unnatural light.

The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. A gem of true seeing or similar magic reveals the presence of a phase door but does not allow its use. A phase door is subject to dispel magic. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a passwall effect. You can allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.

You can't create a simulacrum of a creature whose HD or levels exceed twice your caster level. You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is. A creature familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful Perception check (opposed by the caster's Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive check. At all times, the simulacrum remains under your absolute command. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 hit points or otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly into nothingness.

For the duration of the spell, the ship can travel beneath the water as easily as it did above. While under the effects of this spell, the ship has magical propulsion that gives it a maximum speed of 120 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet (see the Skull & Shackles Player's Guide for details). The ship's pilot uses the normal sailing skill to control the ship while under this spell's effects, and can command it to dive and ascend as part of the vessel's normal movement. Despite the magical propulsion, the ship still requires its crew to perform its normal functions. The spell protects the ship and all aboard from the dangers of drowning and pressure, but not from damage from outside obstacles or creatures. The bubble cannot be used offensively and prevents an affected ship from rising into a space that won't accommodate it (like a sea cave too small to contain it or under another vessel). Creatures can enter or leave the bubble at will, but those outside the sphere cannot be forced inside against their will, the sphere proving substantial enough that such creatures may choose whether to enter or to slip away along its sides. At the end of the spell's duration the bubble pops, causing a ship still underwater at that time to gain the sinking condition. This spell has no effect if cast upon a ship in water that cannot cover the vessel entirely. Although largely beneficial, this spell can be cast on a ship whose pilot does not want to submerge her vessel. The ship itself uses its Will saving throw to resist this effect.","descriptor":"","short_description":"NULL","id":"1474","source":"AP 56","level_string":"cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"7","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"7","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"7"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 minute","components":"V, S, M/DF (a glass marble or piece of soap)","costly_components":"0","duration":"10 minutes/level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"no","targets":"1 sailing vessel"}},{"level":"7","name":"Summon Monster VII","description":"This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 7th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Summons extraplanar creature to fight for you.","id":"536","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, witch 7","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"7","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"7","summoner":"5","witch":"7","wiz":"7"},"elements":["dismissible","focus","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"NULL","school":"conjuration","subschool":"summoning","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 round","components":"V, S, F/DF (a tiny bag and a small candle)","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 round/level","effect":"one summoned creature","range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"7","name":"Symbol of Stunning","description":"This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within 60 feet of a symbol of stunning instead become stunned for 1d6 rounds.

The destination must be an open space on a solid surface. The spell's area overlaps walls and other solid and liquid objects (preventing intruders from bypassing the ward by teleporting into a wall or through similar means). A teleporting creature that is affected by a teleport trap can resist the effect with a Will save-if the save is successful, the creature simply doesn't teleport at all (but the use of the teleport effect is still consumed)-either to the intended location or the teleport trap's actual destination. A DC 27 Knowledge (arcana) allows such a creature to recognize the teleport trap's presence, but does not reveal the trap's linked destination. At your discretion, the teleport trap can exclude a category of creatures, such as an alignment, a type of creature, or creatures that carry a specific item or know a password (though this only works if the creature is teleporting out of the area, not into it). You select this option and the conditions at the time you cast the spell. Overly complicated conditions may cause the spell to fail entirely. Multiple castings of teleport trap can be linked to cover a larger area, allowing teleported creatures to be directed to a single point within the combined area of the spells. Teleport trap can be made permanent at the cost of 7,000 gp. A single permanency spell can be used on all teleport traps that share a linked destination, but the gold piece cost must be paid for each individual spell. The Pathfinders of the Grand Lodge make use of permanent teleport traps in several key locations, trapping would-be intruders in a small wing of jail cells.

The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least half your caster level. You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1. For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to a third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding spells are dismissible. Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2. If you cast any of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature's save succeeds, all binding spells it has received are broken. The binding spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell. Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times. Slumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of binding is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect. Bound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect. Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast. Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. You can't dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or mage's disjunction affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane by dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect.","descriptor":"mind-affecting","short_description":"Utilizes an array of techniques to imprison a creature.","id":"41","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"8","summoner":"6","witch":"NULL","wiz":"8"},"elements":["dismissible","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"enchantment","subschool":"compulsion","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 minute","components":"V, S, M (opals worth 500 gp per HD of the target creature, plus other components as specified below)","costly_components":"1","duration":"see text","effect":"","range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"Will negates; see text","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"one living creature"}},{"level":"8","name":"Call Construct","description":"This spell functions as instant summons, except it can only summon a construct you control.

If the original individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to return). The original's physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails. To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months. When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical to the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including its gaining of two permanent negative levels, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be cloned). If the original creature gained permanent negative levels since the flesh sample was taken, the clone gains these negative levels as well. The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment. A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh which rots if not preserved.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Duplicate awakens when original dies.","id":"78","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 8, witch 8","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"8","summoner":"NULL","witch":"8","wiz":"8"},"elements":["focus","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"necromancy","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"10 minutes","components":"V, S, M (laboratory supplies worth 1,000 gp), F (special laboratory equipment costing 500 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"instantaneous","effect":"one clone","range":"0 ft.","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"8","name":"Create Demiplane","description":"This spell functions as create lesser demiplane, except the area is larger and you can add more features to the plane. You can use this spell to expand a demiplane you created with create lesser demiplane (you do not need to create an entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has a duration of 1 day/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add (or remove) one of the following features to your demiplane with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration. Alignment: Your plane gains the (mildly) chaos-, good-, evil-, law-, or neutral-aligned alignment trait (see Alignment Traits, GameMastery Guide 187). You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have. Bountiful: Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants adapted to near-darkness or underground locations. Elemental: Your plane gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water-elemental dominant trait (see Elemental and Energy Traits, GameMastery Guide 186). Gravity: By default a demiplane's gravity is normal and oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the Material Plane. By selecting this feature, the plane's gravity is heavy, light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional (see Gravity, GameMastery Guide 184). Seasonal: The demiplane has a seasonal cycle and a light cycle, usually similar to those of a land on the Material Plane, but customizable as you see fit (for example, your demiplane could always be winter, day and night could alternate every 4 hours, and so on). Shape: By default, the demiplane has a fixed shape and borders. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge (see Shape and Size, GameMastery Guide 185). You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane. Structure: Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what spells you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner). You can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 20,000 gp.

The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by casting the specified spells on the wall; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A rod of cancellation or a mage's disjunction spell destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field fails to penetrate it. Dispel magic and greater dispel magic can only be used on the wall once all the other colors have been destroyed.

If the Reflex save is successful, the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the boiling pools of acid, writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss. A creature that falls into the pit takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the pit (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the pit's environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the pit rather than at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round, and is randomly selected from acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the pit can make a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The pit's walls have a Climb DC of 25. When this spell's duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within. These creatures take double damage from the rift's environs in that round and are knocked prone as they are returned to the surface above.

The seamantle blocks line of effect for any fire spell or supernatural fire effect, but enemies can attempt to use fire spells within the seamantle; this requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level), and if successful the fire spell takes as a bubble of steam contained within the seamantle rather than its usual effect. The seamantle allows you to make a slam attack by forming a pseudopod of water, inflicting damage appropriate for your size. This slam attack has a reach of 30 feet. In addition, as a standard action, you can attempt to extinguish fires by touch. You automatically extinguish up to a 10-foot cube of normal fire. Against magical fire effects, your touch acts as dispel magic; this also applies to any non-instantaneous fire affect that comes into contact with you (such as flame blade, flaming sphere, or incendiary cloud). Even if you fail to extinguish a fire, you are not harmed by it. A flaming or flaming burst weapon that strikes you has its power suppressed for 1d4 rounds if the wielder fails a Fortitude save.","descriptor":"water","short_description":"Sheathes you in protective water.","id":"874","source":"APG","level_string":"druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"8","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"8","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"8"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal","water"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"conjuration","subschool":"creation","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (a cup of water)","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 minute/level","effect":"","range":"personal","saving_throw":"","spell_resistance":"","targets":"you"}},{"level":"8","name":"Shadow Evocation, Greater","description":"This spell functions like shadow evocation, except that it enables you to create partially real, illusory versions of sorcerer or wizard evocation spells of 7th level or lower.

When triggered, a symbol of death kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again. Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally. As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed. In this case, \"\"reading\"\" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe. You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify. When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again. You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them. Read magic allows you to identify a symbol with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the symbol's spell level). Of course, if the symbol is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol. A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death. Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it. Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal. Note: Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it.

Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken. Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways. Spell Completion: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature's name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters. Trigger Object: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger object.

A wall of lava's maximum height cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object. A section of a wall of lava can be destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall's overall size by one 5-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a wall of lava, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack). A creature can move through a wall of lava as a full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check-failure indicates that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a wall of lava inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A wall of lava also radiates heat as if it were a wall of fire, although the heat from a wall of lava radiates from both sides. Once per round as a move action, you can direct the wall of lava to erupt. This causes a plume of lava to fire at any target within 60 feet of either side of the wall, but reduces the wall's overall size by 1d4 5-foot square sections. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire damage on a hit. Holes created in a wall of lava from this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall. All damage inflicted by physical contact with a wall of lava continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 5d6 or 10d6 points per round).","descriptor":"earth, fire","short_description":"Wall damages foes that try to enter, periodically launches lava at nearby targets.","id":"930","source":"APG","level_string":"druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"8","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"8","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"8"},"elements":["dismissible","earth","fire","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"NULL","school":"conjuration","subschool":"creation","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a chunk of dried lava)","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 round/level (D)","effect":"","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"see text","spell_resistance":"no","targets":"lava wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level (S)"}}],[{"level":"9","name":"Aroden's Spellbane","description":"One of many spells originally created by the Last Azlanti before he became a god, Aroden's spellbane creates an area within which spells selected by you simply do not function.

You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them. You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter. While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by an incorporeal silver cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silver cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. This is a traumatic affair, however, and you gain two permanent negative levels if your second body or astral form is slain. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes. You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).

The mummy is not under your control, but the canopic jars give the bearer certain powers over it. Anyone holding one of the jars can communicate with the mummy as if the two shared a common language. The bearer gains the benefits of protection from evil and sanctuary, but only against that mummy. Unsealing or breaking a jar is a standard action, which dissipates its power (and protection) but lets the bearer issue a short command to the mummy, similar to a suggestion spell (Will DC 23 negates). You (and only you) may unseal all 4 jars in a 10-minute ritual to control the mummy with an similar to geas (Will DC 23 negates); most casters typically include a restriction that the mummy will not harm them, as unsealing the jars leaves them vulnerable.

If the target fails a Reflex saving throw, it is also buried under the resulting rubble as if by a cave-in (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 415).

Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add to your demiplane (or remove from it) one of the following features (or any of the features described in create demiplane) with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration. Energy: Your plane gains the (minor) negative- or positivedominant energy trait (see Elemental and Energy Traits, GameMastery Guide 186). A plane cannot have both the negative-dominant and positive-dominant energy traits. Magic: Your plane gains the dead magic, enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait (see Magic Traits, GameMastery Guide 187). If you selected dead magic, you are trapped within your plane unless it has a permanent planar portal (such as the portal feature, below). If you selected enhanced or impeded magic, choose one type of magic to be enhanced or impeded, such as \"\"effects with the fire descriptor or that manipulate fire\"\" or \"\"death spells and spells from the Death or Repose domains.\"\" A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of spells. Morphic: You may use move earth at will in your demiplane at one-tenth of the spell's normal casting time, and can reshape normal plants in the same manner (such as by twisting trees into a fence or humanlike shapes). You are even able to affect rock formations with this ability, though the casting time for this is only half normal. Portal: Your demiplane gains a permanent gate to one location on another plane, which can only be used for planar travel. This location must be very familiar to you. This gate is always open and usable from both sides, but you can secure it using normal means (such as by building a door around it). Time: By default, time passes at the normal rate in your demiplane. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane have the erratic time, flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait (see Time, GameMastery Guide 185).

First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction. Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate. The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. A gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not. Planar Travel: As a mode of planar travel, a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you-anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel. You may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed. Calling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures. If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time. If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in \"\"livestock\"\" rather than in coin, which could involve complications. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you. Note: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Connects two planes for travel or summoning.","id":"230","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"9","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"9","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"9"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"glory, trade","school":"conjuration","subschool":"creation or calling","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (see text)","costly_components":"0","duration":"instantaneous or concentration (up to 1 round/level); see text","effect":"see text","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"9","name":"Heroic Invocation","description":"Using worlds of ancient power, you bestow heroic powers on all creatures subject to this spell.

Over the surface of open water, the wave travels at a speed of 60 feet per round-on land or underwater, the wave travels at a speed of 30 feet per round. Creatures struck by a tsunami take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (a Fortitude save halves this damage). In addition, the tsunami makes a special CMB check against any creature it strikes-the wave's CMB is equal to your caster level + your relevant spellcasting ability score modifier (whichever is highest) + 8 (for the wave's size). If this CMB check defeats a creature's CMD, the creature is knocked prone and carried along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can attempt to escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a CMB or Swim check opposed by the wave's CMB check-if a creature fails to escape, it takes another 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude save for half ) and continues being carried along by the wave. Objects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller and are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the wave's journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures or objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage when a tsunami passes through its space-if this is enough to destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the wave. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Freedom of movement prevents a creature from being carried along by a tsunami but does not prevent damage caused by it hitting a creature. A solid barrier that is taller than the tsunami that is not destroyed by the wave stops that portion of the wave from continuing onward, leaving a gap in the wave as the rest of it continues forward.","descriptor":"water","short_description":"Huge wave damages and sweeps up all in its path.","id":"916","source":"APG","level_string":"druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"9","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"9","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"9"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal","water"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"oceans","school":"conjuration","subschool":"creation","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"5 rounds","effect":"10-ft.-deep wave 10 ft. wide/level and 2 ft. tall/level","range":"long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)","saving_throw":"see text","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"9","name":"Wail of the Banshee","description":"When you cast this spell, you emit a terrible, soul-chilling scream that possibly kills creatures that hear it (except for yourself ).

Spells or effects with durations expire normally, even while thus suppressed. A spell or with a duration greater than that of the suppression resumes functioning normally when the suppression ends. The wall affects all magical effects, including spells, spelllike abilities, magical items, and any effects stemming from them that pass through the wall. The wall does not suppress a creature's ability to cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or any other sort of limited-use abilities even if the wall suppresses a particular application of those abilities. However, if a creature with magical abilities that are constant or otherwise always active passes through the wall, those abilities are suppressed for the normal duration. The wall blocks line of effect, so no spell or effect can pass through the wall, but it does not block line of sight.

Gases and most gaseous breath weapons cannot pass though the winds. In addition, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can shape your winds so they lash out at that creature as an immediate action.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even wish, however, has its limits. A wish can produce any one of the following effects. • Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools. • Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 7th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools. • Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 7th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools. • Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools. • Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as geas/ quest or insanity. • Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three wishes for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies. • Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. • Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes: one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from gaining a permanent negative level. • Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies. • Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies. You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment, at the GM's discretion.) Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells). When a wish duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 25,000 gp diamond component for this spell).","descriptor":"","short_description":" As limited wish, but with fewer limits.","id":"614","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"sorcerer/wizard 9","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"9","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"9"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"see text","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"universal","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (diamond worth 25,000 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"see text","effect":"see text","range":"see text","saving_throw":"none; see text","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"see text"}},{"level":"9","name":"Wooden Phalanx","description":"You create 1d4+2 wood golems with the advanced template (Bestiary 164, 294).

This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave's type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave. When you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell). The wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM's discretion. The wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave's crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that. The momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city). You can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate.","descriptor":"earth, water","short_description":"Earth moves you across distances.","id":"936","source":"APG","level_string":"druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"9","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"9","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"9"},"elements":["dismissible","earth","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal","water"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"exploration","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, DF","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 round/level or 1 hour/level; see text (D)","effect":"see text","range":"see text","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":""}}]]
