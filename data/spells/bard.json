The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras. 2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft). Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras. Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two. Spell or Object Aura Power Faint Moderate Strong Overwhelming Functioning spell (spell level) 3rd or lower 4th-6th 7th-9th 10th+ (deity-level) Magic item (caster level) 5th or lower 6th-11th 12th-20th 21st+ (artifact) Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: Original Strength Duration of Lingering Aura Faint 1d6 rounds Moderate 1d6 minutes Strong 1d6x10 minutes Overwhelming 1d6 days Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

The message, which must be 25 or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Magic mouth can also be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6thlevel caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

This spell allows you to leave your body and subconsciously monitor the immediate area around any depiction of your image whether one, hundreds, or even thousands. Each such image has the full range of your normal senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.) and you can make a Perception check to notice anything occurring nearby. The DC of this check is always 10 greater than what it would be if you were actually present at that location, so even if you would normally notice something automatically (such as talking, normally a DC of 0), you would need to make a DC 10 Perception check to notice it. You may, at any time, choose to fill one specific image within range with your consciousness. While inside an image you lose the ability to monitor any other images within range but remain fully aware of your own body's surroundings. Your body is defenseless and helpless (always failing any saving throw) while your consciousness is filling an image, but you can return to it at any time as an immediate action. When you fill an image with your consciousness it gains a limited form of animation. Statues and similar three-dimensional representations can move their heads, make gestures, and talk, but cannot attack or leave their square without assistance. Portraits or similar two-dimensional representations bearing your likeness can also talk and your image can move anywhere within the picture or even temporarily alter it (such as by picking a flower in the painting). You cannot use any spells or other abilities while within an image. You may leave the image at any time, returning you to your body. Once your consciousness departs from an object bearing your likeness, it immediately reverts to the appearance it had before you entered it. If someone destroys or damages the image you return to your body unharmed. The spell lasts until you cease concentrating, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as a dispel magic cast upon either the image or your body, or if your body is killed.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Transfers your consciousness to an object bearing your likeness.","id":"764","source":"APG","level_string":"bard 2, cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"2","cleric":"3","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"3"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a drop of paint and a ball of clay)","costly_components":"0","duration":"concentration","effect":"transfer consciousness to any object bearing your likeness","range":"50 ft./level","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"2","name":"Enthrall","description":"If you have the attention of a group of creatures, you can use this spell to hold them enthralled.

Any potentially affected creature of a race or religion unfriendly to yours gets a +4 bonus on the saving throw. A target with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher remains aware of its surroundings and has an attitude of indifferent. It gains a new saving throw if it witnesses actions that it opposes. The effect lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1 hour. Those enthralled by your words take no action while you speak or sing and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those entering the area during the performance must also successfully save or become enthralled. The speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose concentration or do anything other than speak or sing. If those not enthralled have unfriendly or hostile attitudes toward you, they can collectively make a Charisma check to try to end the spell by jeering and heckling. For this check, use the Charisma bonus of the creature with the highest Charisma in the group; others may make Charisma checks to assist. The heckling ends the spell if this check result beats your Charisma check result. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle).

The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.

Blink has several effects, as follows. Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment). If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike. Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane). While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures. You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material. While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones. An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Cancels one magical spell or effect.","id":"159","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"bard 3, cleric 3, druid 4, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3, inquisitor 3, antipala, magus 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"3","bard":"3","cleric":"3","druid":"4","inquisitor":"3","magus":"3","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"3","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"3","wiz":"3"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"magic","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"instantaneous","effect":"","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":"one spellcaster, creature, or object"}},{"level":"3","name":"Displacement","description":"The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location.

For example, if the target has been dominated by a vampire, you can use evidence left in the target's mind to learn about that vampire. Each minute you concentrate on the spell, you can learn your choice of one of the following pieces of information. Direction: The controller's general direction and distance. Emotion: The controller's emotional state (gloating, sated, frightened, angry, and so on). Image: A powerful iconic image relevant to the controller or its connection to the target, such as a symbol on a door or a name on a gravestone. Location: The controller's general location, such as \"\"in a large city\"\" or \"\"on a ship.\"\" Name: The name by which the target knows its controller (if any). All of this information is based on the last time the influencing creature linked itself to the target, either to issue a command or to receive sensory input from the target. For example, if at nightfall a vampire commanded a dominated victim to walk to a cemetery, this spell can reveal the vampire's general location at that time, though it may have moved since then.","descriptor":"mind-affecting","short_description":"NULL","id":"1593","source":"Blood Of The Night","level_string":"bard 3, inquisitor 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"3","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"3","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"NULL","witch":"3","wiz":"3"},"elements":["dismissible","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"cone-shaped emanation","divine_focus":"1","domain":"NULL","school":"divination","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, F/DF (a copper piece)","costly_components":"0","duration":"concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)","effect":"","range":"60 ft.","saving_throw":"Will negates; see text","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"3","name":"Elemental Speech","description":"This spell enables you to converse with creatures associated with a chosen element, including but not limited to true elemental creatures.

If the card and target's alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit's check. If the card and target's alignments are of the opposite alignment (see below), the card inflicts a -1 penalty on that associated check. If the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit's check. While penalties persist on all associated checks for as long as the harrowing persists, the bonuses are one-use bonuses that the harrowed character can \"\"spend\"\" at any time to modify that card's associated check. You can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll. Since all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing are luck bonuses, they do not stack with each other. Penalties, on the other hand, do stack. Once you spend all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing, or once the spell's duration ends, the spell ends and the penalties are removed. A single creature can only be under the effects of one harrowing at a time. If it is subjected to a second harrowing while a previous harrowing is still in effect, the new harrowing automatically fails.

The text containing the symbol must be at least 25 words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the sepia snake sigil springs into being, transforming into a large sepia serpent that strikes at the reader, provided there is line of between the symbol and the reader. Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike. If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of duncolored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level have elapsed. While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends. The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical. A dispel magic can remove the sigil. An erase spell destroys the entire page of text.

For example, you could erase a single battle from a creature's memory, or all knowledge of a plot to assassinate a king. The memories you remove are stored within the gem used at the time of casting. If the gem is shattered, the memories return to the creature as long as the two are within 30 feet of each other. Once sequester thoughts has been cast, the spell remains active on the gem and can be dispelled (which shatters it). No portion of the spell remains active on the target creature, and the target does not radiate magic as a consequence of the spell, nor can its memories be returned by dispelling the creature or subjecting it to antimagic. If the gem is shattered or dispelled out of range from the creature, the thoughts sequestered within are forever lost save by the use of wish, miracle, or the like. Sequester thoughts protects against detect thoughts, zone of truth, discern lies, and similar spells where the memories removed are concerned, though careful questioning may reveal the gaps in the creature's memory, or that it has been affected by the spell.

Stolen light stores images within a gem. To store an image, as part of casting you must touch a gem worth not less than 500 gp. You trap within the gem an image of everything visible within a 30-foot cone measured from the gem, in a direction of your choice. Alternatively, you can capture a less detailed image of a single object within sight. Once the casting is complete, the gem turns opaque, and the image inside cannot be seen. The stolen image remains within the gem until released or dispelled. To release an image, you touch a gem holding stolen light as a standard action and speak a command word chosen at the time of casting. For 1 minute per caster level, the image stored within the gem becomes visible. Details can be made out as clearly as they could be perceived at the time of casting. Darkvision is of no use for making out details in a stolen image, though low-light vision or other exceptional visual talents may reveal information the caster did not see. Light sources brighter than bright light are reduced to bright light in the stolen image. Once the image has been released, it cannot again be recovered from the gem. Stolen light can be made permanent with the permanency spell by a caster of 10th level for a cost of 5,000 gp.

If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as \"\"Come here,\"\" \"\"Go there,\"\" \"\"Fight,\"\" and \"\"Stand still.\"\" You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description). Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action. By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on. Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it. If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.

You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other. In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane. Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 x 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10 x 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save). Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours. Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.","descriptor":"shadow","short_description":"Step into shadow to travel rapidly.","id":"478","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 6, alchemist 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"6","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"5","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"6","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"6"},"elements":["dismissible","mind-affecting","shadow","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"darkness","school":"illusion","subschool":"shadow","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 hour/level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"up to one touched creature/level"}},{"level":"5","name":"Shadowbard","description":"You conjure up a quasi-real phantom singer that is visible as a shifting, shadowy duplicate of yourself.

The target humanoid can be either conscious or unconscious, but must understand your language. Upon casting this spell, you must state a course of action you wish the target to take. This course of action must be described in 20 words or fewer. You must then state the condition under which you wish the target to take this action, also describing it in 20 or fewer words. Actions or conditions more elaborate than 20 words cause the spell to fail. Unconscious agenda cannot compel a target to kill himself, though it can compel him to perform exceedingly dangerous acts, face impossible odds, or undertake almost any other course of activity. You cannot issue new commands to the target after the spell is cast. If the target fails his save against this spell, he is not compelled to act in any way until the specified trigger circumstances are encountered. He also has no knowledge of the details of the spell affecting him, and has no memory of the last 10 minutes (although he might come to notice the missing time or the presence of the caster). He can function as he wishes until the events you detailed as the condition take place. Upon experiencing the prerequisite condition, the target is forced to perform the course of action you described as per the spell dominate person. (If the compelled action is against the victim's nature, he immediately gains a new saving throw at a +5 bonus against the spell to end its effects.) For the next hour, the target acts as you dictated, doing all he can to fulfill your command. If, at the end of the hour, the target still has not completed your command, the target is released from the enchantment and the spell ends. Once the course of action is completed, the spell ends. The target has full memory of acts performed during this hour. It's difficult to detect an unconscious agenda before the spell is triggered. Casting detect magic on one affected by it only reveals an aura of enchantment if the caster of detect magic has a higher caster level then the caster of unconscious agenda. Even if the spell is detected, it can only be removed by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish. Dispel magic does not affect unconscious agenda.","descriptor":"language-dependent, mind-affecting","short_description":"NULL","id":"1579","source":"RotRL-AE-Appendix","level_string":"bard 6, inquisitor 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"6","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"6","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"6","summoner":"NULL","witch":"6","wiz":"6"},"elements":["dismissible","mind-affecting","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"enchantment","subschool":"compulsion","language_dependent":"1"},"casting":{"casting_time":"10 minutes","components":"V","costly_components":"0","duration":"One week/level or until discharged (D)","effect":"","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"Will negates","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"One humanoid"}},{"level":"6","name":"Veil","description":"You instantly change the appearance of the subjects and then maintain that appearance for the spell's duration.
