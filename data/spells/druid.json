The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras. 2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft). Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras. Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two. Spell or Object Aura Power Faint Moderate Strong Overwhelming Functioning spell (spell level) 3rd or lower 4th-6th 7th-9th 10th+ (deity-level) Magic item (caster level) 5th or lower 6th-11th 12th-20th 21st+ (artifact) Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: Original Strength Duration of Lingering Aura Faint 1d6 rounds Moderate 1d6 minutes Strong 1d6x10 minutes Overwhelming 1d6 days Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind. Medium or smaller creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed at a DC 15 Strength check. Large or larger creatures may move normally within a gust of wind effect. This spell can't move a creature beyond the limit of it's range. Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -4 penalty on ranged attacks and Perception checks in the area of a gust of wind. The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those in lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights. In addition to the effects noted, a gust of wind can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range. Gust of wind can be made permanent with a permanency spell.","descriptor":"air","short_description":"Blows away or knocks down smaller creatures.","id":"251","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, magus 2","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"2","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"2","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"2","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"2"},"elements":["air","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"catastrophe","school":"evocation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 round","effect":"line-shaped gust of severe wind emanating out from you to the extreme of the range","range":"60 ft.","saving_throw":"Fortitude negates","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":""}},{"level":"2","name":"Gusting Sphere","description":"A swirling ball of wind rolls in whichever direction you point, hurling those it strikes with great force. The sphere is treated in all ways as an area of severe wind (Core Rulebook 439), applying a -4 penalty on ranged weapon attacks that pass through it. The sphere moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space containing a Medium or smaller creature, it stops moving for that round and generates a sharp thrust of wind to bull rush the creature. The sphere's CMB for bull rush combat maneuvers uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +2 bonus for its Strength score (14). Whether or not the bull rush is successful, the creature takes 1d6 points of nonlethal bludgeoning damage from the attack. If the bull rush fails, the creature is still subject to the severe winds from the sphere as long as they remain in the same square as it. A gusting sphere rolls over objects or barriers that are less than 4 feet tall. The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest.

Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface. Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.

Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal air in its place. If the cloud is too large for you to affect with a single casting of this spell, you may instead inhale a portion of the cloud, but you must inhale the portion of the cloud closest to you. This spell has no effect on gaseous creatures. It can only affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to cast the spell in response. While inhaled, the cloud does not harm you. You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for up to 1 round per level, but you must hold your breath to do so (even if you do not normally have to breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you counts toward that duration. As a standard action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60-foot cone (or the cloud's original area, if smaller than a 60-foot cone). Any creature in the breath's area is subject to its normal effects, making saving throws and spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud's original DC.

At the end of a creature's turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed.

Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the air walk spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.

Blast barrier, however, has proven to be an exceptionally versatile spell as far as terrains are concerned, for it works equally well in swamps, deserts, or any region where the ground is soft or easy to shape. When you cast blast barrier, you cause a rippling wall of loose earth, mud, snow, sand, or gravel to spring up in a designated space within the spell's range. This wall provides total cover to all Large or smaller creatures and objects. The barrier can only spring up in an area of natural, unworked ground. The energy that forms the wall's matrix is unstable, and you must concentrate to maintain the wall's shape. A blast barrier has an AC of 9, hardness 0, and 5 hit points per caster level. When a blast barrier reaches 0 hit points, or when you cease concentrating on maintaining it, the energies that maintain the barrier's shape fail with explosive results, sending sharp chunks of the materials comprising the wall and magical energy out along both sides. Any creature that is adjacent to a blast barrier when it explodes takes 2d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of sonic damage per 3 caster levels (maximum 6d6). A successful Reflex save halves the total damage done. Spell resistance applies as well. This instability can make using a blast barrier risky, but many of the spellcasters that pioneered the spell became experts at its tactical applications, often using the barriers to cover an escape while lobbing spells and parting shots, hoping to trigger the barrier's destruction just as their would-be pursuers approached.","descriptor":"","short_description":"","id":"1254","source":"Inner Sea Magic","level_string":"druid 4, ranger 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 4","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"4","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"3","sor":"3","summoner":"NULL","witch":"4","wiz":"3"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"sonic","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (handful of snow, earth, or gravel)","costly_components":"0","duration":"concentration, up to 1 round/2 levels","effect":"1-ft.-thick wall up to 10 ft. high by 20 ft. wide","range":"close (25 ft. + 5ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"Reflex half (see below)","spell_resistance":"yes (see below)","targets":""}},{"level":"4","name":"Blight","description":"This spell withers a single plant of any size.

The first version of this spell causes water in the area to swiftly evaporate or to sink into the ground below, lowering the water's depth. The second version causes the water to surge and rise, increasing its overall depth and possibly flooding nearby areas. Lower Water: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level Ã— 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures. Raise Water: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Cancels one magical spell or effect.","id":"159","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"bard 3, cleric 3, druid 4, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3, inquisitor 3, antipala, magus 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"3","bard":"3","cleric":"3","druid":"4","inquisitor":"3","magus":"3","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"3","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"3","wiz":"3"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"magic","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"instantaneous","effect":"","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":"one spellcaster, creature, or object"}},{"level":"4","name":"Earth Glide","description":"The target can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water, traveling at a speed of 5 feet.

Any creature entering the geyser, or occupying the square it appears in, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid being hurled into the air and then tossed to the ground. If the creature fails its saving throw, it takes 3d6 points of fire damage from the boiling water and also takes falling damage based upon the height of the geyser (e.g., if the geyser is 50 feet tall, the creature takes 5d6 falling damage), landing prone in a random square adjacent to the geyser. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the creature's normal movement. In addition, the geyser sprays boiling water in a hemispherical emanation around its square. The radius of this emanation is equal to one-half the geyser's height (e.g., a 50-foot geyser has a 25-foot-radius emanation). Any creature within this area, including yourself, takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round as droplets of boiling water cascade on them. You can choose to make a smaller geyser than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of boiling rain that's smaller than what would be created by a full-height geyser spell.","descriptor":"fire, water","short_description":"Creates a geyser of boiling water.","id":"795","source":"APG","level_string":"druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 5, magus 5","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"4","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"5","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"5","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"5"},"elements":["fire","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal","water"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"NULL","school":"conjuration","subschool":"creation","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a piece of lava rock)","costly_components":"0","duration":"concentration + 1 round/level","effect":"spout of boiling water filling a 5 ft. square and spraying upward 10 ft./2 levels","range":"long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)","saving_throw":"Reflex partial (see below)","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"4","name":"Giant Vermin","description":"You turn a number of normal-sized centipedes, scorpions, or spiders into their giant counterparts (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary).

If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw. Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated. A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcreature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell. It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character. For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table on the next page. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created. A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated.

The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings). Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected. Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no additional cost. Restore Class: A paladin, or other class, who has lost her class features due to violating the alignment restrictions of her class may have her class features restored by this spell. Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of her deity may regain that ability by seeking atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric must expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings for her god's intercession. Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally. Though the spell DESCRIPTION refers to evil acts, atonement can be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, regardless of the actual alignment in question. Note: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of atonement offers a method for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Removes burden of misdeeds from subject.","id":"28","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 5, druid 5, inquisitor 5","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"5","druid":"5","inquisitor":"5","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"NULL","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"NULL"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"purity","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 hour","components":"V, S, M (burning incense), F (a set of prayer beads or other prayer device worth at least 500 gp), DF","costly_components":"1","duration":"instantaneous","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"living creature touched"}},{"level":"5","name":"Awaken","description":"You awaken a tree or animal to human-like sentience.

Wind Strength: For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level. Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effect of being in the windy area. See Environment for more details.

You also gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution and a +5 bonus on all Diplomacy checks made when interacting with creatures of the same elemental subtype as your chosen genie. In addition, you gain other abilities depending upon the type of genie you choose to assume the form of, as detailed below.

This has three effects. First, the target is marked with a magical symbol visible only to members of your faith. This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it. Likewise, the target is not to be persecuted because of the mark (though this would not keep members of a lawful faith from imprisoning a known criminal if these crimes were known to have taken place after he gained the mark). Second, the target is no longer affected by helpful spells cast by the faithful and is always treated as an enemy for the purpose of other spells cast by those of your faith. For example, cure light wounds cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast prayer, that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target's friendship with the cleric. Third, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target. This powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment. However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges. This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down. This mark can be removed like any other curse effect. In addition, a member of your faith can use atonement to break the curse if he makes a caster level check against your caster level; remove curse also requires a caster of your faith and a caster level check to end the reprobation.","descriptor":"curse, see text","short_description":"Marked target is shunned by your religion.","id":"1129","source":"Ultimate Magic","level_string":"cleric 5, druid 5, inquisitor 4, paladin 4","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"5","druid":"5","inquisitor":"4","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"4","ranger":"NULL","sor":"NULL","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"NULL"},"elements":["curse","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 minute","components":"V, S, DF","costly_components":"0","duration":"permanent","effect":"","range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"one creature of your faith"}},{"level":"5","name":"Rest Eternal","description":"You place a curse upon a dead creature that bars its spirit from returning.

Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes piercing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an AC of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.) You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier. Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage. Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage. A wall of thorns can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work.

The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire.

This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.

The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast. Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble. Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Environment for more details). Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud. Pinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.","descriptor":"earth","short_description":"Intense tremor shakes 80-ft. radius.","id":"174","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 8, druid 8","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"8","druid":"8","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"NULL","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"NULL"},"elements":["earth","mind-affecting","shapeable","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"80-ft.-radius spread","divine_focus":"1","domain":"destruction, earth","school":"evocation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, DF","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 round","effect":"","range":"long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)","saving_throw":"see text","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"8","name":"Euphoric Tranquility","description":"A creature under the effect of this enchantment enters a state of euphoria.

You gain improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) against foes that do not have freedom of movement effects. The cover granted by the seamantle does not enable you to make Stealth checks or prevent attacks of opportunity. Magical attacks against you are unaffected unless they require attack rolls or state that they do not function underwater (such as cloudkill). The seamantle blocks line of effect for any fire spell or supernatural fire effect, but enemies can attempt to use fire spells within the seamantle; this requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level), and if successful the fire spell takes as a bubble of steam contained within the seamantle rather than its usual effect.

A wall of lava's maximum height cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object. A section of a wall of lava can be destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall's overall size by one 5-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a wall of lava, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack). A creature can move through a wall of lava as a full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check-failure indicates that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a wall of lava inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A wall of lava also radiates heat as if it were a wall of fire, although the heat from a wall of lava radiates from both sides. Once per round as a move action, you can direct the wall of lava to erupt.

You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire damage on a hit. Holes created in a wall of lava from this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall.

If this CMB check defeats a creature's CMD, the creature is knocked prone and carried along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can attempt to escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a CMB or Swim check opposed by the wave's CMB check-if a creature fails to escape, it takes another 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude save for half ) and continues being carried along by the wave. Objects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller and are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the wave's journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures or objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage when a tsunami passes through its space-if this is enough to destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the wave. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Freedom of movement prevents a creature from being carried along by a tsunami but does not prevent damage caused by it hitting a creature.

These winds grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability. Neither your armor nor your load affects this fly speed.

Ranged weapons (including giant-thrown boulders, siege weapon projectiles, and other massive ranged weapons) passing through the winds are deflected by the winds and automatically miss you. Gases and most gaseous breath weapons cannot pass though the winds. In addition, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can shape your winds so they lash out at that creature as an immediate action.

On a successful save, the damage is halved and the creature is not knocked prone (or checked or blown away).","descriptor":"air","short_description":"Grants flight; attack with wind.","id":"935","source":"APG","level_string":"cleric 9, druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"9","druid":"9","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"9","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"9"},"elements":["air","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"wind","school":"evocation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, DF","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 minute/level","effect":"","range":"personal","saving_throw":"","spell_resistance":"","targets":"you"}},{"level":"9","name":"World Wave","description":"You cause any sort of natural terrain (including water, forest, desert, tundra, and so on) to surge beneath your feet and safely propel you with devastating force over great distances. This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave's type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave. When you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell). The wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM's discretion. The wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave's crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that. The momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city). You can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate.","descriptor":"earth, water","short_description":"Earth moves you across distances.","id":"936","source":"APG","level_string":"druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"9","inquisitor":"NULL","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"9","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"9"},"elements":["dismissible","earth","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal","water"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"exploration","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, DF","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 round/level or 1 hour/level; see text (D)","effect":"see text","range":"see text","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":""}}]]
