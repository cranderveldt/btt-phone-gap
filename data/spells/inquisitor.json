The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras. 2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft). Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras. Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two. Spell or Object Aura Power Faint Moderate Strong Overwhelming Functioning spell (spell level) 3rd or lower 4th-6th 7th-9th 10th+ (deity-level) Magic item (caster level) 5th or lower 6th-11th 12th-20th 21st+ (artifact) Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: Original Strength Duration of Lingering Aura Faint 1d6 rounds Moderate 1d6 minutes Strong 1d6x10 minutes Overwhelming 1d6 days Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects such as charm person, command, and dominate person). This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using magic jar), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.","descriptor":"good","short_description":"+2 to AC and saves, plus additional protection against selected alignment.","id":"416","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric/oracle 1, inquisitor 1, paladin 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, summoner 1","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"1","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"1","magus":"NULL","oracle":"1","paladin":"1","ranger":"NULL","sor":"1","summoner":"1","witch":"NULL","wiz":"1"},"elements":["dismissible","good","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"good, purity","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF","costly_components":"0","duration":"1 min./level (D)","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"no; see text","targets":"creature touched"}},{"level":"1","name":"Protection from Good","description":"This spell functions like protection from evil, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made by good creatures.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth.

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action. A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual weapon's AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object). If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Cancels one magical spell or effect.","id":"159","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"bard 3, cleric 3, druid 4, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3, inquisitor 3, antipala, magus 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"3","bard":"3","cleric":"3","druid":"4","inquisitor":"3","magus":"3","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"3","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"3","wiz":"3"},"elements":["mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"magic","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"instantaneous","effect":"","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"no","targets":"one spellcaster, creature, or object"}},{"level":"3","name":"Domination Link","description":"This spell functions like detect thoughts, with the additional ability to find echoes of the thoughts of a creature mentally controlling the target. For example, if the target has been dominated by a vampire, you can use evidence left in the target's mind to learn about that vampire. Each minute you concentrate on the spell, you can learn your choice of one of the following pieces of information. Direction: The controller's general direction and distance. Emotion: The controller's emotional state (gloating, sated, frightened, angry, and so on). Image: A powerful iconic image relevant to the controller or its connection to the target, such as a symbol on a door or a name on a gravestone. Location: The controller's general location, such as \"\"in a large city\"\" or \"\"on a ship.\"\" Name: The name by which the target knows its controller (if any). All of this information is based on the last time the influencing creature linked itself to the target, either to issue a command or to receive sensory input from the target. For example, if at nightfall a vampire commanded a dominated victim to walk to a cemetery, this spell can reveal the vampire's general location at that time, though it may have moved since then.","descriptor":"mind-affecting","short_description":"NULL","id":"1593","source":"Blood Of The Night","level_string":"bard 3, inquisitor 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"3","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"3","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"NULL","witch":"3","wiz":"3"},"elements":["dismissible","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"cone-shaped emanation","divine_focus":"1","domain":"NULL","school":"divination","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, F/DF (a copper piece)","costly_components":"0","duration":"concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)","effect":"","range":"60 ft.","saving_throw":"Will negates; see text","spell_resistance":"no","targets":""}},{"level":"3","name":"Eldritch Fever","description":"The target gains the eldritch ague spellblight (see page 96).","descriptor":"curse, disease, evil","short_description":"Target gains the eldritch ague spellblight.","id":"1047","source":"Ultimate Magic","level_string":"inquisitor 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"3","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"NULL","witch":"3","wiz":"3"},"elements":["curse","disease","evil","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"necromancy","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard","components":"V, S","costly_components":"0","duration":"instantaneous","effect":"","range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"Fortitude negates","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"one creature"}},{"level":"3","name":"False Alibi","description":"This spell functions similar to modify memory, except you can modify the target's memory only in a specific way.

Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance. This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only. A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself. You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20. A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above. This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa.","descriptor":"good","short_description":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","id":"330","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 3, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, inquisitor 3, summoner 3, inquisitor 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"3","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"3","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"3","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"NULL","wiz":"3"},"elements":["good","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","divine_focus":"1","domain":"good","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","costly_components":"0","duration":"10 min./level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"no; see text","targets":""}},{"level":"3","name":"Magic Circle against Good","description":"This spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from good instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.","descriptor":"evil","short_description":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","id":"332","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, inquisitor 3, antipaladin 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"3","bard":"NULL","cleric":"3","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"3","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"NULL","wiz":"3"},"elements":["evil","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","divine_focus":"1","domain":"evil","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","costly_components":"0","duration":"10 min./level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"no; see text","targets":""}},{"level":"3","name":"Magic Circle against Law","description":"This spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from law instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature.","descriptor":"chaotic","short_description":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","id":"333","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, inquisitor 3, antipaladin 3","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"3","bard":"NULL","cleric":"3","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"3","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"3","summoner":"3","witch":"NULL","wiz":"3"},"elements":["chaotic","material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","divine_focus":"1","domain":"chaos","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","costly_components":"0","duration":"10 min./level","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","spell_resistance":"no; see text","targets":""}},{"level":"3","name":"Magic Vestment","description":"You imbue a suit of armor or a shield with an enhancement bonus of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).

This has three effects. First, the target is marked with a magical symbol visible only to members of your faith. This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it. Likewise, the target is not to be persecuted because of the mark (though this would not keep members of a lawful faith from imprisoning a known criminal if these crimes were known to have taken place after he gained the mark). Second, the target is no longer affected by helpful spells cast by the faithful and is always treated as an enemy for the purpose of other spells cast by those of your faith. For example, cure light wounds cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast prayer, that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target's friendship with the cleric. Third, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target. This powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment. However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges. This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down. This mark can be removed like any other curse effect. In addition, a member of your faith can use atonement to break the curse if he makes a caster level check against your caster level; remove curse also requires a caster of your faith and a caster level check to end the reprobation.","descriptor":"curse, see text","short_description":"Marked target is shunned by your religion.","id":"1129","source":"Ultimate Magic","level_string":"cleric 5, druid 5, inquisitor 4, paladin 4","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"5","druid":"5","inquisitor":"4","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"4","ranger":"NULL","sor":"NULL","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"NULL"},"elements":["curse","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"NULL","school":"transmutation","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 minute","components":"V, S, DF","costly_components":"0","duration":"permanent","effect":"","range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"one creature of your faith"}},{"level":"4","name":"Restoration","description":"This spell functions like lesser restoration, except that it also dispels temporary negative levels or one permanent negative level.

Although it still bears some of the stigma of being associated with the Midnight Lord, it's rapidly becoming a favorite spell of magi and other martially minded arcane spellcasters. When you cast this spell, you create a shadowy spiked chain that shimmers and pulses with darkness. The chain exists as long as you carry it; if you ever drop the chain, give it to another, or are disarmed, it immediately vanishes and the spell's duration ends. The chain radiates darkness in a 10-foot-radius spread around you, reducing the illumination level in this area by one step, but not below the level of dim light.

The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings). Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected. Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no additional cost. Restore Class: A paladin, or other class, who has lost her class features due to violating the alignment restrictions of her class may have her class features restored by this spell. Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of her deity may regain that ability by seeking atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric must expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings for her god's intercession. Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally. Though the spell DESCRIPTION refers to evil acts, atonement can be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, regardless of the actual alignment in question. Note: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of atonement offers a method for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Removes burden of misdeeds from subject.","id":"28","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 5, druid 5, inquisitor 5","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"5","druid":"5","inquisitor":"5","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"NULL","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"NULL"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"1","domain":"purity","school":"abjuration","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 hour","components":"V, S, M (burning incense), F (a set of prayer beads or other prayer device worth at least 500 gp), DF","costly_components":"1","duration":"instantaneous","effect":"","range":"touch","saving_throw":"none","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"living creature touched"}},{"level":"5","name":"Banishment","description":"A banishment spell is a more powerful version of the dismissal spell.

You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting unhallow again. Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect magic, detect good, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth.

The target humanoid can be either conscious or unconscious, but must understand your language. Upon casting this spell, you must state a course of action you wish the target to take. This course of action must be described in 20 words or fewer. You must then state the condition under which you wish the target to take this action, also describing it in 20 or fewer words. Actions or conditions more elaborate than 20 words cause the spell to fail. Unconscious agenda cannot compel a target to kill himself, though it can compel him to perform exceedingly dangerous acts, face impossible odds, or undertake almost any other course of activity. You cannot issue new commands to the target after the spell is cast. If the target fails his save against this spell, he is not compelled to act in any way until the specified trigger circumstances are encountered. He also has no knowledge of the details of the spell affecting him, and has no memory of the last 10 minutes (although he might come to notice the missing time or the presence of the caster). He can function as he wishes until the events you detailed as the condition take place. Upon experiencing the prerequisite condition, the target is forced to perform the course of action you described as per the spell dominate person. (If the compelled action is against the victim's nature, he immediately gains a new saving throw at a +5 bonus against the spell to end its effects.) For the next hour, the target acts as you dictated, doing all he can to fulfill your command. If, at the end of the hour, the target still has not completed your command, the target is released from the enchantment and the spell ends. Once the course of action is completed, the spell ends. The target has full memory of acts performed during this hour. It's difficult to detect an unconscious agenda before the spell is triggered. Casting detect magic on one affected by it only reveals an aura of enchantment if the caster of detect magic has a higher caster level then the caster of unconscious agenda. Even if the spell is detected, it can only be removed by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish. Dispel magic does not affect unconscious agenda.","descriptor":"language-dependent, mind-affecting","short_description":"NULL","id":"1579","source":"RotRL-AE-Appendix","level_string":"bard 6, inquisitor 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"6","cleric":"NULL","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"6","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"6","summoner":"NULL","witch":"6","wiz":"6"},"elements":["dismissible","mind-affecting","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"","divine_focus":"0","domain":"NULL","school":"enchantment","subschool":"compulsion","language_dependent":"1"},"casting":{"casting_time":"10 minutes","components":"V","costly_components":"0","duration":"One week/level or until discharged (D)","effect":"","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","saving_throw":"Will negates","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":"One humanoid"}},{"level":"6","name":"Undeath to Death","description":"This spell functions like circle of death, except that it destroys undead creatures as noted above.","descriptor":"","short_description":"Destroys 1d4 HD/level undead (max. 20d4).","id":"584","source":"PFRPG Core","level_string":"cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, inquisitor 6","class_levels":{"alchemist":"NULL","antipaladin":"NULL","bard":"NULL","cleric":"6","druid":"NULL","inquisitor":"6","magus":"NULL","oracle":"NULL","paladin":"NULL","ranger":"NULL","sor":"6","summoner":"NULL","witch":"NULL","wiz":"6"},"elements":["material","mind-affecting","somatic","verbal"],"restrictions":{"deity":"","area":"several undead creatures within a 40-ft.-radius burst","divine_focus":"1","domain":"glory, repose","school":"necromancy","subschool":"","language_dependent":"0"},"casting":{"casting_time":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (diamond powder worth 500 gp)","costly_components":"1","duration":"instantaneous","effect":"","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","saving_throw":"Will negates","spell_resistance":"yes","targets":""}},{"level":"6","name":"Vision of Lamashtu","description":"This spell functions exactly as the spell nightmare.

The second spell's range is irrelevant for the purposes of vision of Lamashtu, and even touch attacks can be delivered in this manner (you must still make a successful touch attack in order to affect the target, though, with the act of touching occurring within the context of the victim's nightmare). The target is allowed to save against the second spell if a save is allowed.
